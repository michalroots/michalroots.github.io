I"&<p><strong>This website is my digital garden, journal, archive, portfolio, playground and open documentation of stuff I do.</strong> I had this crazy idea for a while to put it all in one place, and I finally managed to manifest it, which is a huge victory because I don’t know how to code and I’m teaching myself as I go along. <br /></p>

<p>Pow ✨.</p>

<p>I’m using a <strong>Macbook Pro mid 2012</strong>. This is the last computer from Apple that allows for easy replacement of parts. With 16GB of RAM and an SSD (soon 2x SSD) the computer allows me to edit videos, photos, write, code and enjoy films etc, without much friction for my use case.</p>

<p><strong>I highly recommend fixing rather than buying new stuff.</strong> It’s cheaper, often less difficult that you thought it will be, you will learn something new, and it helps us collectively to shift towards a new way of being, not driven by exponential consumption. <a href="https://ifixit.com" target="_blank"> Ifixit</a> has some great guides for fixing stuff. <a href="https://100r.co/site/about_us.html" target="_blank">100 Rabbits</a> create excellent documentation of their explorations of low-tech solutions.</p>

<p>I’m running <strong>MacOS Mojave</strong>. I’d like to eventually move back to Linux, but two times I tried to make it work (once with Ubuntu and once with ElementaryOS) I failed miserably. Third times the charm?</p>

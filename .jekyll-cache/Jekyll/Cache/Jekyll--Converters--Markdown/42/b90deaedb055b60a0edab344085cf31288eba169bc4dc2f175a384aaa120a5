I"9<p>Back in December I committed to 33 consecutive days of 30 minutes yoga without skipping a single day. Long story short: I did it.</p>

<p>To be honest - it was not difficult. <strong>I‚Äôve set the difficulty bar well</strong> - right at the edge between feeling easy and feeling challenging to start, and <strong>I made it absolutely non-negotiable under any circumstances</strong> knowing the importance of delivering on that vow to myself.</p>

<p>Stepping into my 33rd rep on the day of my 34th birthday felt like bliss.</p>

<p>With the original commitment out of the way I simply continued showing up to my practice. I was in the middle of a crazy fast travel, when for over a month I moved every couple of days, and, perhaps paradoxically, it felt easier to just keep on doing my practice every day. It served as a grounding ritual shifting my awareness into the body in the midst of all the changes in the external environment. It was a perfect fit.</p>

<p>Eventually, I came back home and decided to recommit. One hundred days. Actually, make it one hundred and one, because it feels like a good number of unbroken reps.</p>

<p>I did it again, although I admit that I could feel my commitment energy drop significantly. I still kept showing up, but there were more days when I wasn‚Äôt showing up fully. ‚ÄúBad days‚Äù are a natural part of the commitment and, in fact, are the most important ones.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It‚Äôs when you don‚Äôt feel like it, and yet you show up anyway, that the muscles of will grow.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still - I kept noticing that the frequency of these days increased, which kept draining my motivation further down.</p>

<p>Eventually there was not much left, but then‚Ä¶ I hit the 101 mark.</p>

<p><strong>Setting the right time frame is another critical piece of the Art of Commitment.</strong> <strong>A longer period increases the probability of giving up</strong> - either through random life events or, like in my case, motivation dropping down with time. On the other hand, <strong>the longer your streak, the more badass you feel</strong> so there is definitely immense value in high number of reps. Completing 101 consecutive days of 30 minutes yoga practice without skipping a beat felt very fucking good.</p>

<p>I decided to ride the wave of completion and recommitted to 125 days. Another 24 days felt doable.</p>

<p>On day 119 I quit.</p>

<p><strong>Ending a non-negotiable commitment well is a mission-critical part of the process.</strong></p>

<p>I kept noticing that my motivation is quite low, and the frequency of days when I push through is increasing. And then, one day after the most amazing yoga session I had in a long time, with a glass totally full with recommitment energy, I suffered an injury rendering it impossible to continue in the same format.</p>

<p>I tried to change my practice to a very gentle movement on the yoga mat, and then shifted to moving the energy in my body in a healing process, but the truth is - my heart was not in the original commitment to 125 days of yoga.</p>

<p>I have no time for bullshit. I had two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Recommit immediately and kept pushing through</li>
  <li>Let go</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>I chose the later knowing well that I didn‚Äôt honour my commitment, and yet, quitting was a respectful thing to do</strong>. My heart wasn‚Äôt there, my body wasn‚Äôt fully mobile, and I needed to prioritise healing rather than forcing myself.</p>

<p>In other words, <strong>my current life circumstances were not aligned with my commitment, and while I absolutely could have chosen to do it regardless, I made a conscious decision not to</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead, <strong>I decided to renegotiate my commitment</strong>.</p>

<p>And then I weaved it into a card representing my current core practices so I can see it all the time.</p>

<p>Redirecting the commitment energy into a different practice is a fantastic lifeline but also a very tricky ground. Similarly to the original non-negotiable commitment it deserves consideration and respect.</p>

<p><strong>An easy trap to fall into, is to redirect the energy from a place of half-assing</strong> - <em>well, that thing didn‚Äôt work out, so let me try this other thing</em>. It‚Äôs easy to slip into not taking the new commitment seriously, which will most likely backfire - in a form of giving up during one of the first challenging periods.</p>

<p>Building on the first rule of habit building - never skip twice - <strong>it‚Äôs time to regain trust in myself by honouring my commitment no matter what</strong>.</p>

<p>This requires setting the commitment well.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the commitment?</li>
  <li>What is the timeframe?</li>
  <li>Am I ready to make it a non-negotiable vow, knowing well that if I fail to deliver it will harm my feeling of self-worth and trust in myself?</li>
</ol>

<p>With full awareness of the stakes at play, I decided to commit to a daily swim.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/never-regret-swim.jpg" alt="One Never Regrets a Swim Card" /></p>

<p>I am in an environment where I can go into the water daily, unless the sea state is completely wild, and even if it is, there is a high chance I can find a spot to get into the water. There is a possibility that external circumstances beyond my control (as in: Nature) will make it impossible, in which case I will accept it and have a long cold shower instead. But I will go out of my way to find a spot to swim.</p>

<p>Respecting that my body is still not fully healed, I set the bar low - All I need to do is to fully submerge in the water. I can then get out immediately. This feels like a good bar of difficulty - no brainer on easy days, and whenever I don‚Äôt feel like swimming at all, it‚Äôs still easy to drag my ass into the water.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt need to commit to more - once submerged I‚Äôll enjoy it tremendously.</p>

<p>Once my new commitment is crystal clear to me, I ponder on the timeframe that feels good. I‚Äôll set a low bar this time because I want to reduce the risk of failure. Still, I want something that feels like a bit of a challenge and aligns with my natural rhythms.</p>

<p>I choose to commit to a daily swim until the next New Moon. That‚Äôs 21 days away from today, and I have a head start of 4 completed days, which is a good start of momentum.</p>

<p>Am I ready to commit?</p>

<p>ABSOLUTELY.</p>

<p>üê†</p>

<p>How about you?</p>

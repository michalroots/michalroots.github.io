I"!<p>Ahoy there!</p>

<p>It is so, that <strong>Micha≈Ç (that‚Äôd be me) decided to become a professional pirate</strong> - <strong>and enrolled into the <a href="https://ezsenglish.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Enkhuizer Zeevaartschool</a> (Netherlands)</strong> - the world‚Äôs finest School of the Nautical Arts training tall ship sailors.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs a tall ship, you ask?</p>

<p>( ‚òùÔ∏è That‚Äôs the courtyard of the school, and my very, very excited self. )</p>

<p>üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è</p>

<h2 id="im-looking-for-a-home-for-my-studies-oct-23---apr-24">I‚Äôm looking for a Home for my studies (Oct 23 - Apr 24)</h2>

<p>Ideal match:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>a sailboat / houseboat / RV that could use a winter steward</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>a house sit</strong></li>
  <li><strong>a good, old-fashioned rental</strong>, although my budget is rather thin for Dutch market prices.</li>
  <li><strong>a house swap</strong> with the <a href="/cabin" target="_blank">Wizard Cabin</a> in the woods or 1 bed epic house in Pico Island.</li>
  <li>open to other options - you name it!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Location: Amsterdam / Enkhuizen / somewhere around</strong>. The school is located in Enkhuizen and I need to be there only one day per week, the rest is study time at home - so I can travel further for ideal match.</p>

<p>üè°</p>

<p><strong>I‚Äôm a pirate wizard living in Pico Island (Azores) and building a Forest Sanctuary and a Pirate Base.</strong> I‚Äôve been here for 3 years+, supporting local projects and creating a gift economy allowing people to thrive with minimal reliance on financial capital (growing food, sharing resources).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/guide-michal-lq.jpg" alt="Micha≈Ç guide pic" /></p>

<p>Professionally, <strong>I create relational growth experiences and catalyse groups to unlock their creative potential</strong>. I work with positive impact projects, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Traditional Dream Factory</strong> - a regenerative coliving in Portugal</li>
  <li><strong>Enspiral</strong> - a global network helping people do more meaningful work</li>
  <li><strong>Treehouse DAO</strong> - a regenerative publishing studio</li>
</ul>

<p>‚õµÔ∏è</p>

<p><strong>I‚Äôm enrolling into a pro sailing school to move forward on my journey to host transformational experiences at sea and connect positive impact projects worldwide with a fleet of sailboats</strong>. Plus, personally speaking, sailing is when I feel the most alive.</p>

<p>üíú</p>

<p><strong>I‚Äôd be super grateful for any leads &amp; divine connections. Please send them my way!</strong></p>

<p>Wishing you a beautiful day!<br />

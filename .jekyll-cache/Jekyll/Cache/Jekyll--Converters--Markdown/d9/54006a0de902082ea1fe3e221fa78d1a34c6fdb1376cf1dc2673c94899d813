I"’<p>Context: I wrote this text while at sea (original scan at the end), a couple of days after departing from Edinburgh, which used to be my Home for seven years, and it still does feel like my hometown somehow.</p>

<p>Back then, I sailed into a new chapter of my life, which funny enough is now about to end with another <a href="Sailing%20Career%20Development.md" target="_blank">Sailing Career Development</a> adventure taking me to whatever awaits next.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm in the process of recording this text as a spoken-word-music collaboration with <a href="https://instil.bandcamp.com/album/wide-spectrum-of-beautiful-chaos" target="_blank">Jo√£o Moreira aka Instil</a>. For now the pre-premiere version is <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/illuminated-pre-66220721" target="_blank">available for my Patrons</a>.</p>

<p>‚õµÔ∏è</p>

<p>Time is gone<br />
and along with the sea<br />
my heart is beating<br />
setting the tone<br />
for discovery<br /></p>

<p>I‚Äôm floating and believing<br />
That what I still can‚Äôt see<br />
Is right there<br />
in front of me<br />
waiting patiently<br />
until I‚Äôm ready <br />
to notice.<br /></p>

<p>I‚Äôm gone<br />
and I‚Äôm here<br />
the same,<br />
but always different.<br />
and it‚Äôs hard to put this feeling into words, <br />
so I convince myself that<br />
perhaps there is no point<br />
in doing so.<br />
And I float<br /></p>

<p>on words words words<br />
that matter not<br />
sailing my desires<br />
towards true north<br />
fully aligned <br />
with this present moment<br /></p>

<p>What a bliss!<br /></p>

<p>And I am grateful for every breath and sound <br />
every passing wave we found<br />
gently caressing the hull <br />
of this sweet abyss.<br /></p>

<p>The Sun is about to kiss<br />
the horizon, bringing yet another night<br />
at sea<br /></p>

<p>My soul is singing peacefully<br />
with sweet melodies<br />
of tranquility<br />
I now found<br /></p>

<p>There is so much space around! <br />
So much to fill with joy<br />
and birds are calling us down<br /></p>

<p>There is so much to witness!<br /></p>

<p>There is so much life around! <br />
And our little boat is an integral part<br /> 
of the infinite vastness of truth, <br />
moving through the waves that found<br /> 
us, <br />
as we cross gently<br />
Towards the open horizon<br /> 
Towards the setting Sun<br />
Towards an undefined place<br />
at the right pace<br /></p>

<p>A pace that feels right.<br /></p>

<p>We‚Äôre moving slowly <br />
Deliberately<br />
Taking time to breathe<br />
and sing with courage<br />
In tune with the world <br />
we‚Äôre a part of.<br /></p>

<p>As fast as the wind permits.<br /> 
As fast as our dreams.<br /></p>

<p>We grow <br /></p>

<p>We grow and let go and move on<br />
To finally feel at ease <br />
At home.<br /></p>

<p>And who knows‚Ä¶<br />
Maybe one day I‚Äôll find you on a journey towards a distant shore? <br />
Being mesmerised<br />
for a few moments more<br />
together<br />
in awe<br />
with the everpresent water<br />
carrying us away<br />
Wherever we would like to go<br />
provided that the Ocean will be kind<br /> 
to our Souls<br />
and our fragile bodies<br /></p>

<p>There is no need to fear this magnificent old being.<br />
Fear kills<br />
by clouding hearts<br />
with dread<br /></p>

<p>Instead, <br />
Let‚Äôs Be Courage, Love and Respect,<br />
being grateful for every breath<br />
and every mile behind us<br />
and in front of us<br />
And again<br />
Let‚Äôs sing together with the roaring wind <br />
and dance on every passing wave<br />
celebrating being alive <br />
and awake<br />
right now<br />
right Here <br /></p>

<p>we are present<br />
pure and vulnerable,<br />
Facing our true essence:<br /></p>

<p><strong>Being weak, <br />
and strong enough to admit it.</strong> <br /></p>

<p>adrift with purpose<br />
and committed<br />
to the heartbeat of the Earth<br />
dreaming awake<br />
tuned and reflected <br />
in patterns<br />
of the waves<br /></p>

<p>illuminated<br /></p>

<p>and <br /></p>

<p>connected<br /></p>

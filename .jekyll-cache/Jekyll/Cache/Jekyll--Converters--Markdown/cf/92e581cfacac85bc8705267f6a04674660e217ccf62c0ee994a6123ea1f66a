I"Ì<p>Iâ€™m here with you<br />
holding space<br />
curiously patiently<br />
getting to know you<br />
and yet <br />
Iâ€™m loosing myself<br /> 
in seeking connection<br />
and somehow forget <br />
to take a breath<br />
and ask<br /></p>

<p>instead<br />
I speak from the heart<br />
opening up <br />
yet taking space<br /> 
that I wish to hold<br />
letting myself unfold<br />
into the night<br />
combining your essence<br />
with my luminescence<br />
so bright<br /></p>

<p>eyes close <br />
eyes meet <br />
we breathe<br /></p>

<p>youâ€™re my guide<br /> 
my teacher<br />
my mirror<br /></p>

<p>making me aware<br /> 
of uncomfortable truths<br />
for which Iâ€™m grateful<br /></p>

<p>Iâ€™m with you and them <br />
and all the questions <br />
with no comprehension<br />
floating around<br />
yet with courage anew<br />
drawing closer to you<br />
timelessly suspended <br />
our fears befriended<br />
witnessing a moment<br />
of blossoming<br /></p>

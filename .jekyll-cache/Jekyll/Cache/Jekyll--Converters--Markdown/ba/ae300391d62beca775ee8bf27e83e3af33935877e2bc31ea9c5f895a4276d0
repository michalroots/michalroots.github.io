I"Î<p>Following the success of our first <a href="/pico-community-summer-gathering-2021" target="_blank">Summer Gathering</a> we hosted our second gathering in October 2021.</p>

<p><strong>The intention was to take the next step in the community building process, by tuning into our individual visions of what community in Pico could look like, and discovering how we could support each other in making these dreams come true in the context of our island with all itâ€™s blessings and limitations.</strong></p>

<p>We called it: <strong><em>Stepping Into Belonging</em></strong>.</p>

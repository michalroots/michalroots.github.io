I"<p>Context: <em>Magic Spells</em> was the first full-on party design I created, bringing local artists to transform a flat being into an interactive playground.</p>

<p>Magic: Transforming a regular party, with all the usual patterns (drinking / socialising) into a magical exploration by engaging people in interactions with the space.</p>

<p>My Role: Concept, installation exploring facebook addiction, sound installation in the bathroom, video projection</p>

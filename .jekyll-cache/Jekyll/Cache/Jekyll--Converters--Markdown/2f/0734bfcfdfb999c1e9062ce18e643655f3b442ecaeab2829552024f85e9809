and she appears waving<br />
from behind the curve<br /></p>

<p>they sit still together feeling what needs to be said<br />
and yet <br /></p>

<p>no words come out<br /></p>

<p>so they wait<br /></p>

<p>listening to the sound of birds <br />
and wind and time passing by<br />
there is clearly something in the air<br />
and yet <br /></p>

<p>no words are coming out<br /></p>

<p>a tear slides down her cheek<br />
merging with a soft smile<br />
there’s closeness embedded so deep<br />
and yet<br /></p>

<p>there are no words coming out<br /></p>

<p>he closes his eyes for a moment<br />
they know each other so well<br />
and when he looks up she is gone<br /></p>

<p>and no words need to be said.<br /></p>

<p><em>No Words came out after a powerful meeting without words.</em></p>

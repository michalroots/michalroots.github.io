<p><strong>I lived in many homes and this one was my favourite - a tiny wooden cabin in the middle of a beautiful forest, with a window into the Ocean.</strong></p>

<p>I was given an opportunity to live here and customise the insides to fit my lifestyle. Wood is a perfect canvas. Over a few months the Cabin transformed into a powerful creativity boosting power place, and a blueprint for my future Home.</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<p>A wise man once said that it takes three houses to build a perfect one. While I haven‚Äôt built the cabin myself (I only helped a bit with finishing and did some interior improvements), it gives me a great starting point for creating my first home, whenever the time for it comes.</p>

<p>A few improvements I‚Äôd consider doing with the cabin design:</p>

<ul>
  <li><del><strong>Sand and varnish all the wood inside</strong> - without it there‚Äôs plenty of wood dust, which can‚Äôt be too healthy to breathe.</del></li>
  <li><strong>Invest in good doors</strong> - the doors to the cabin are not very thick and in very heavy rainfall the water comes through.</li>
  <li><strong>Opening windows at the top</strong> - this would add an easy way to keep the air flowing in times when opening the front doors is not a viable option.</li>
  <li><strong>Add a wood burning stove</strong> - this is a bit tricky, since it‚Äôs a tiny wooden house, but there must be a way to have a tiny wooden stove inside to heat the place up in winter without relying on electricity.</li>
  <li><strong>Consider adding insulation</strong> - I‚Äôm not 100% sure about this because it would take some precious space, but it might be worthwhile especially on cold days. It would be a big improvement to add insulation at the roof only.</li>
  <li><strong>Soundproofing the roof</strong> - when it rains it can get very loud inside. Insulation would do the trick.</li>
  <li><strong>Instal a basic water system outside</strong> - I have a bucket with the water collected from the roof, which works, but adding a tiny bit of sophistication would be great.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep the food out</strong> - it‚Äôs not the cabin‚Äôs fault per se (I just don‚Äôt have a good food storage around), but I‚Äôd much rather not keep my eating station inside.</li>
  <li><strong>Add a trap door / hidden back door</strong> - for fun, and to have a second exit.</li>
  <li><strong>Cat flap</strong> for Kiki to move freely in and out üêà.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other reflections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add 3m multiplug with 6 sockets, each with it‚Äôs own switch</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deep-work-retreat">Deep Work Retreat</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm on a quest to raise funds for a community land in Pico, with a forest, a community space and a few cabins serving as a deep work / creative / personal regeneration retreat centre.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôd like to help to make this dream a reality, have a look at this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zbz3Ka5x7zVrJwBafn2mdW2oqRrdxNXoIMzwTkZiFIY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">project brief</a>.

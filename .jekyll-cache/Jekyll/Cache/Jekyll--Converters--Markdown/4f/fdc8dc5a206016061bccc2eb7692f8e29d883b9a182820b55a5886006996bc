I"e<p>Iâ€™m falling asleep tonight <br />
having touched you <br />
having held you <br />
connected. <br /></p>

<p>The doorway opened <br />
shaping a path towards your Soul <br />
and in a brief moment of courage <br />
I took a leap to move closer. <br /></p>

<p>You met me halfway <br />
our eyes met <br />
our souls met <br />
and so did our bodies <br /></p>

<p>I felt shivers that moment <br />
the kind that shake me <br />
and make me feel <br />
alive <br /></p>

<p>My body is still humming quietly <br />
as I sink into myself at night <br />
being present and being a part <br />
of you. <br /></p>

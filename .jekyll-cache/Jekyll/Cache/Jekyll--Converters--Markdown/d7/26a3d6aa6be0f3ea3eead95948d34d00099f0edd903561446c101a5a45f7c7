I"Í<p>Context:</p>

<p>Back in Summer 2021 I felt a call to ditch the comforts of living in a house and moved to a Magical Forest on an ocean cliff.</p>

<p>Sinking into the sounds of trees and waves every night brought up a lot of emotions and internal processes, which I decided to channel into heartfelt poems.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d like to compile it all into a small booklet with illustrations one day, but for now enjoy the raw words, as they came straight from the heart into the pages of my journal.</p>

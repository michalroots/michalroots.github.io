I"‡n<p>Back in February 2024 I reached out to <a href="https://daneelminev.com/" target="_blank">Daneel</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ani-anca/" target="_blank">Ani</a> with a proposal to test our collaboration. Eight months later we concluded <strong>a month long mastermind bringing together 14 people to write the first book about semi-nomadism, build friendships, and create a community driven publishing studio</strong>.</p>

<p>TLDR: The book is now <a href="https://treehousecollective.earth/how-to-semi-nomad/" target="_blank">done</a> and the mastermind worked so well that we‚Äôre having another one in April 2025 (more info at the end).</p>

<h2 id="why-spend-a-month-co-writing-a-book">Why Spend A Month Co-Writing A Book?</h2>

<p>Brining people for long enough in-real-life spaces to create something together is my ikigai.</p>

<p>Allow me to dissect:</p>

<h3 id="1-long-enough">1. Long Enough</h3>

<p><strong>Relationships grow at the speed of trust, and a few days is simply too short to go deep enough and ground the emerging connection with a solid foundation for a lasting friendship</strong>. Sure, you can amplify depth and bonding with facilitation tricks and make people feel super connected over a weekend, but <strong>the <em>real good stuff</em> takes time</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-nomad-vibe-curve.jpg" alt="Graph visualising short vs long container" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Living together for a month feels like being a part of an established ecosystem. There are routines, rituals, ongoing conversations, and evolving building blocks of culture shaped together by a group. Most importantly - there‚Äôs plenty of time to get to know each other, while resting well, and continuously integrating the experience.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-hikers.jpg" alt="Cards with culture puzzles" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ Taking time to explore the absolutely stunning nature, with hundreds of kilometers of hikes starting right at our doorstep.</em></p>

<p>Speaking of continuous integration ‚Äì you‚Äôre quite unlikely to hit pause on everything else happening in your life for an entire month, which naturally weaves your inside-the-container experience with everything outside of it. There is no separation.</p>

<h3 id="2-in-real-life">2. In Real Life</h3>

<p>Ya, ya, enough zoom calls, thank you. IRL is more effective, more fun, more human. And hey, I‚Äôd choose being with you in person rather than on screen every time. And if we have an entire month together, then wow, I really can‚Äôt wait!</p>

<p><em>üì∏ Exploring the space during one of the open space workshops.</em></p>

<h3 id="3-creating-together">3. Creating Together</h3>

<p><strong>There‚Äôs nothing quite like getting to know a person through collaborating with them</strong>. Hanging out in an unstructured open space is fantastic, and yet, setting a direction of creating a tangible deliverable within the time time together is a game-changer. The delightful clash of ideas, communication styles, working approaches, personal focus areas, and fluctuating energy levels reveals potential matches for a long-term friendship and/or collaboration, and creates a feeling of a shared group identity anchored in the lived experience <em>and</em> in the physical artefact.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-container-artefact.jpg" alt="Facilitators with the artefact and the process" width="100%" /></p>

<p>In our case we wrote a freaking 190-page book in one month. It is a journey to remember and be proud of.</p>

<h2 id="container-design">Container Design</h2>

<p>Our first book-writing prototype hosted at the <a href="https://traditionaldreamfactory.com" target="_blank">Traditional Dream Factory</a> in 2022 lasted 11 days and gathered 28 people. Together with my co-facilitator Daneel we prototyped everything from scratch in real time. Our energy was relentless. We finished the mastermind with a completed pdf of ‚Äú<a href="https://treehousedao.earth/" target="_blank">How To Build A Regenerative Village</a>‚Äù and Treehouse DAO - an idea for a publisher. While the process worked well, we didn‚Äôt have enough space and capacity for tying loose ends, which resulted in two critical flaws:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We didn‚Äôt plan for editing and post-production.</li>
  <li>We didn‚Äôt have clear agreements for decision making and financial flows.</li>
</ol>

<p>Womp womp.</p>

<p>The result was a two year process to complete the last 5% needed to print the book. Learning from that experience, we reshaped the process completely, arriving at what seems to be a replicable month-long book writing container that kicks ass.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how it works.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-made-a-book-in-55-hours-">How We Made A Book In 55 Hours üòé</h3>

<p>55 hours?</p>

<p>We spent one month together but the actual book-making sessions lasted 3 hours x 5 days per week x 3 weeks = 45 hours total. Let‚Äôs add another 10 hours to account for the extra push on the last days and we‚Äôll get somewhere close to 55 hours for a 190-page book.</p>

<p>THIS IS INSANE.</p>

<p>Of course, sprinting for 55 hours straight wouldn‚Äôt work. To make it possible we needed to make time for creating group coherence, rest, subconscious processing and all the other good stuff on the community side of things.</p>

<p>The result was the following plan:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-nomad-container.jpg" alt="Container design" width="100%" /></p>

<p><strong>Week one focused on community weaving and creative foreplay</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We got to know each other</li>
  <li>We made agreements on how we want to be together</li>
  <li>We made <a href="https://vermonthub.ch" target="_blank">Vermont Hub</a> our home</li>
  <li>We made agreements around copyrights and money flows</li>
  <li>We established individual &amp; group routines</li>
  <li>We introduced cards - our primary co-creation medium</li>
  <li>We prompted subconscious processing for the table of contents</li>
  <li>We hosted an open day inviting locals from Leysin which connected us to the local scene</li>
  <li>We had an epic hike</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-culture.jpg" alt="Cards with culture puzzles" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ A few pieces of our culture puzzle.</em></p>

<p>Something we haven‚Äôt planned was that many of us came to the mastermind with a personal sub-quest of stepping up their exercise routine. As a result most of us got a monthly pass to the local sport centre and started a daily mix of squash, swim, iceskating, archery and gym. Combined with the sauna we had at home, it kept our bodies in a fantastic shape throughout the month and provided a critical off-switch for the brainz üß†.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-archers.jpg" alt="Archery class" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ That delightful day when we did an archery class together.</em></p>

<p><strong>Week two is when we started to make pages</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We introduced the book-writing process</li>
  <li>We crafted a short story</li>
  <li>We created the table of contents</li>
  <li>We created the first draft of the book - all with cards.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-cards-to-pages.jpg" alt="A scan from our log depicting our daily process" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ Sneak peek into our log containing the historical picture of the very first card played during the mastermind</em></p>

<p><strong>At the end of week three we showcased the book to the public.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We introduced our upgraded collaborative writing OS in Figma (so damn sexy)</li>
  <li>We digitalised, printed, and displayed pages on the wall, gallery style, and invited the locals to have a look and give us feedback</li>
  <li>We hosted a digital event including a layer of engagement on <a href="https://pol.is/3uknvwxnxt" target="_blank">polis</a> and <a href="https://t.me/+S9wYSmjLOhZhMWNk" target="_blank">telegram</a></li>
  <li>We opened pre-orders to fund the first print round</li>
  <li>We designed the model for <a href="https://treehousecollective.earth" target="_blank">Tree House Collective</a> - our community driven publishing studio</li>
  <li>We had a well deserved party</li>
  <li>We went for another epic hike!</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-printed.jpg" alt="Printed book on the wall" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ It‚Äôs quite a sight to witness all of the pages printed for the first time.</em></p>

<p>On a community-building note, week three became ‚Äúthe dating week‚Äù. The well-established group coherence naturally shifted the attention towards intentional 1:1s and deepening individual bonds. This is where long-term collaborations started to reveal themselves.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-love-three.jpg" alt="Three people walking together" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ That‚Äôs a pic of a trio date, but you get the idea üòâ.</em></p>

<p><strong>Week four is when we finished the book.</strong> It was intense. The time pressure finally kicked in hard, both on completing the book and deepening the relationships.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We started with taking an extra day of rest (very needed)</li>
  <li>We finalised the book in a hyperfocus mode</li>
  <li>We had a great farewell party</li>
  <li>We close the mastermind with a retrospective</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-nomad-cover-back.jpg" alt="Book front and back cover" width="100%" /></p>

<p>That‚Äôs it. The book is done and <a href="https://treehousecollective.earth/how-to-semi-nomad/" target="_blank">available to order</a>.</p>

<p>The last step is the final day of rest and departures.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-closing-cuddle.jpg" alt="A cuddle puddle after closing ceremony" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ One of the best live feedback was the cuddle puddle after the closing ceremony resulting in falling asleep together. It warms my heart to witness such a degree of comfort and proximity.</em></p>

<h3 id="zooming-in-on-daily-routine">Zooming In On Daily Routine</h3>

<p><strong>Our working days started at 09h55 with a <em>round of check-ins</em> followed by <em>Decentralised Needs Meeting</em> and <em>Open Space</em>.</strong> We deliberately set the start time quite late to give people time to have an unrushed morning routine, breakfast, and for these early risers have some focused time for getting some personal work done.</p>

<p><strong>Decentralised Needs Meeting</strong> served as a space for anyone to express any need they might have without the pressure on the collective to meet the need. The objective is two-fold: a) practice verbalising needs b) increase chances of getting them met. After all, how can I know you need a massage if you keep it a secret?</p>

<p><strong>Open Space is a collective practice of coordinating activities for the day</strong>. Anyone could propose any activity to happen in any time outside of the 3 hour book making session.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples to showcase the variety:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a trip to a local farm</li>
  <li>contact improv</li>
  <li>watching a film</li>
  <li>intro to Ayurveda</li>
  <li>intro to Enspiral</li>
  <li>a workshop prototype around lessons we can learn from being at sea</li>
  <li>and more‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-morning.jpg" alt="Morning session vibes" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ The delightful vibe of our morning moment together.</em></p>

<p>After the moment of creating a daily group coherence and planning the day we jumped into 3 hours of book creation playtime (more on that later).</p>

<p>Next, we‚Äôd float into lunch served by our amazing chef <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anotherjosefina/" target="_blank">Josefina</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-food.jpg" alt="Food pic. Yes, it looks super tasty" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ A food pic for your delight.</em></p>

<p>Afternoon varied from day to day depending on open space offerings, but usually included a session of squash or other physical activity, before coming back together again for dinner prepped by daily rotating teams.</p>

<p>Evenings depended on open space, and usually the day ended with someone turning on the sauna üî•. And then, half way through the mastermind, we discovered that sauna in the morning is an amazing way to start the day. We also discovered that quite a few of us were waking up very early which kickstarted our 5am/6am/7am club.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-squares.jpg" alt="Ticking boxes" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ Here‚Äôs the boxes representing images to make. Our <a href="https://tessvandorp.com" target="_blank">illustrator Tess</a> is smashing it from the early morning üé®.</em></p>

<p>That‚Äôs it for work days.</p>

<p>On the first day of the weekend people tended to disappear into their own recharge modes. The house felt super quiet and cozy.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-rest.jpg" alt="Deep rest time" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ A well deserved moment of ultimate chill. Bonus points for the hat!</em></p>

<p>On the second day the energy was back and we‚Äôd go for a hike, or just hang out in nature. This is also when many great creative ideas for the book sparked and we begun our famous balcony sessions.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-balcony.jpg" alt="Balcony vibes" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ The vibe is always excellent on the balcony.</em></p>

<h3 id="zooming-in-on-3h-creative-sprints">Zooming in on 3h Creative Sprints</h3>

<p>The book was done in dedicated 3 hour sessions. No AI, just the limitless human creativity in flowstate with cards as a primary medium.</p>

<p>The process goes through stages of free-flow brainstorming and sense-making, constrained by the format of book pages, which keeps the group focused and effective. In the meantime, our illustrator keeps on drawing.</p>

<p>The speed is incredible. Our daily record was 51 pages!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-cardification.jpg" alt="Playing with cards" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ The daily process of cardification.</em></p>

<p><strong>The most important part is, of course, the vibe. We are able to co-create so effectively because we‚Äôre in a constant state of play with the group quickly learning how to self-facilitate and adjust the process to match the energy in the room.</strong></p>

<p>The result is a beautiful illustrated book.</p>

<h2 id="why-semi-nomadism">Why Semi-Nomadism?</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve started this article with the process, because (in my opinion) the process makes 65% of the mastermind experience. On the other hand, the book is the focusing point for the month and the reason why we came together.</p>

<p>We picked the topic of semi-nomadism because it feels relevant and fascinating to explore.</p>

<p>The (digital) nomad lifestyle is by now quite well established in the global awareness, with a plenty of people living this way and plenty of resources and services catering to their needs. In the same time I keep noticing a growing need for stability and roots. I feel it myself - traveling is fantastic, but being constantly on the move doesn‚Äôt fulfil me anymore. I wish to have a base (or a few bases) to come back to, and see their growth over a longer period of time, while growing myself shaped by it. <strong>This mutual shaping - of a place by the person, and of a person by the place became a somewhat of a guiding definition for what a semi-nomad actually is</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-nomad-preview-definition.jpg" alt="Page preview" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ Preview of the book pages.</em></p>

<p>The word semi-nomad itself was fascinating to dissect.</p>

<p>After all the prefix <em>semi</em> indicates being ‚Äúpartly something‚Äù, so being ‚Äúnot quite nomadic‚Äù. While accurate to a degree, we felt that it puts too much emphasis on the nomadic aspect, while the key piece of the puzzle for us was the aspect of having a home, or multiple homes.</p>

<p>We explored alternative word choices (such as <em>homad</em> and <em>rooted nomad</em>), but in the end decided to stay with <em>semi-nomad</em>, as a good enough and safe enough. Our fired brains produced a wonderful poem though:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-poem.jpg" alt="Semi Nomad Poem" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>üì∏ It was fun to read it out loud during dinner.</em></p>

<p>If you have better words to describe the phenomena, you can contribute to the conversation on <a href="https://pol.is/3uknvwxnxt" target="_blank">polis</a> and <a href="https://t.me/+S9wYSmjLOhZhMWNk" target="_blank">telegram</a>.</p>

<p>The definition was one of many rabbit holes we embarked upon. <strong>The book is a snapshot of our collective exploration of the subject through multiple lenses, such as self, relationships, practical life-admin stuff (hooray tax and health insurance) and offers a collection of perspectives to consider when choosing to build a semi-nomadic lifestyle.</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few pages to look at:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-preview-gnome.jpg" alt="Page preview" width="100%" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-preview-container.jpg" alt="Page preview" width="100%" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-preview-home.jpg" alt="Page preview" width="100%" /></p>

<p>I mentioned already the feeling of shared identity stemming from creating a tangible deliverable together. I can‚Äôt wait to see the smile on authors faces when they will hold the physical print in their hands for the first time.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs also something around the medium of a book itself that is particularly appealing. A book is a book. It is a format well recognised by both the mainstream and alternative pockets of cultural landscape and it carries a degree of seriousness and respectability that can transmit the ideas into the wider ecosystem.</p>

<p>After all, <strong>we‚Äôre writing about topics within the wide ranging spectrum of regeneration, community and culture, with the intention of inspiring others to co-create a world where all beings can thrive</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>‚Äú</em>I‚Äôm leaving with more than just filled pages. I carry with me a renewed sense of my worth, a strength that comes from a community with shared alignment, and a desire to infuse more magic into every moment..‚Äù*<br />

  <li>community rituals / habits / practices / culture blocks</li>
  <li>cuddle puddles</li>
  <li>business opportunities</li>

<p>Future metrics to track (note to self):</p>

<ul>
  <li>returning authors</li>
  <li>time to print</li>
  <li>time to repay authors</li>
  <li>authors meeting in other containers</li>
  <li>average number of pages per day</li>

<h2 id="improvements-braindump">Improvements Braindump</h2>

<p>While the process flew extremely well there is definitely space for improvements. Here are a few ideas.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bring in the external proof-reading earlier</li>
  <li>Host the open day in a city (more people)</li>
  <li>Page auction to fund the first print run</li>
  <li>Use the open day digital walkthrough as a base structure for the promo video &amp; improve the quality of sound</li>
  <li>Invite previous authors to the open day and build a THC gathering around it</li>
  <li>Improve the promotion of the authors with dedicated boost sessions, eg. improve your linkedin, website etc with the collective brainpower - make this a part of the container design!</li>
  <li>Consider dropping the group deeper in the first week</li>
  <li>Play more with creating and decentralising roles</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="personal-learnings">Personal Learnings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It is the longest container I‚Äôve hosted so far and I absolutely loved it. I‚Äôm curious to experiment with even a longer format.</li>
  <li>My intuition was confirmed - the month-long mastermind format is DOPE. We‚Äôll surely iterate on it every time but the basic framework is set and it works like a charm. I feel super happy and proud of building this experience.</li>
  <li>It is also the perfect container for me to exist within. Hanging out with people I love and creating something meaningful together makes me feel alive like not many other things. This is the lifestyle I want, and luckily I am building it.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm ready to scale this up as a service and create impact and value for aligned organisations</li>
  <li>The last week of the month was intense with pretty much no mental capacity for anything else. Next time I wish to accommodate better for it.</li>
  <li>A month long container is a perfect anchor to build habits, such as an exercise routine.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p><strong>We‚Äôre now collecting pre-orders to fund the first print run. We expect to ship in November/December 2024. The next (mega) milestone is to sell ~5000 copies to pay authors back before the next mastermind in April 2025.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You can <a href="https://treehousecollective.earth/how-to-semi-nomad" target="_blank">order your copy here</a> and this would make a tremendous difference for us!</strong></p>

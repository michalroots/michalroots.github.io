<h2 id="dear-santa">Dear Santa,</h2>

<p>I am in a privileged position of my basic monthly expenses being more or less covered by my online business, at least for now.</p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt easy to get here.</p>

<p>It took four years of being constantly challenged by the entrepreneurial learning curve. One of the biggest difficulties revolves around money. In a nutshell: <strong>I feel very little alignment with the current capitalist system and I‚Äôd like to embody a different paradigm.</strong></p>

<p>But that isn‚Äôt easy when I depend on my own business to bring income. On one hand I am fully committed to release products that genuinely enrich lives and contribute to co-creating a beautiful planet where all beings can thrive. On the other, I feel pressure to make enough to pay the basic expenses. With the entrepreneurial world saturated with content prioritizing making more money rather than <em>why</em> and <em>how aligned</em>, it‚Äôs been hard to stay grounded and maintain a relatively steady course aligned with what my heart believes in.</p>

<p>But it‚Äôs been kinda working lately, and I feel that my work is tuning in more and more with my values, while bringing in enough financially to sustain my basic needs, and leaving more time and energy to <em>give freely</em> to work that matters that I don‚Äôt want to charge for within the capitalist economy.</p>

<p>Because, I deeply believe that <strong>not everything should be monetized</strong>.</p>

<p>Regenerating the land.</p>

<p>Healing oneself and others.</p>

<p>Sharing the Light to inspire and encourage more people to enter into the upwards spiral of the beautiful world that our hearts know is possible <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>These are my priorities, and while I‚Äôm committed to this path anyway, I could certainly use your help. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this letter to ask you for a Gift.</p>

<p>As a minimalist on a constant journey to have less items and more space, I learned that offering a gift is a beautiful but challenging art. For example, for a long time my family kept giving me stuff, which while being given from the heart and therefore appreciated, was, generally speaking, useless for me and only created unnecessary clutter.</p>

<p>What I learned through this process is:</p>

<p>a) experiences generally make much better gifts for me.</p>

<p>b) it is my responsibility to communicate clearly which gifts are the most aligned with what my heart points me towards right now, instead of expecting another person to know that intuitively.</p>

<p>This letter is an externalisation of these two lessons in a form of a public wishlist, supported by a firm belief that there is plenty of abundance of different sorts all around, and that within the Gift Economy (which we are indeed all a part of) the gifts gravitate towards the place where they are needed most.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not saying that the items on my list are <em>universally speaking</em> the biggest voids in the universe waiting to be filled. <strong>I already have all that I need.</strong> However, it is possible that you are in a position to fill these voids for me, and thus make a real positive impact in my life, and, through ripple effect, the lives of others.</p>

<p>Whether that‚Äôs the case or not, I‚Äôm grateful for your presence, and I wish you wonderful Winter Holidays, whichever and whenever you choose to celebrate.</p>

<p>With Love and Gratitude,<br />
Micha≈Ç.</p>

<p>ps. The List is <a href="/gift">here</a></p>

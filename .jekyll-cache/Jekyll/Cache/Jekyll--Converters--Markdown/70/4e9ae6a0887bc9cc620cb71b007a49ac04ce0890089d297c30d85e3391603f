<h2 id="dear-lizbon">Dear Lizbon,</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s our last night together and Iâ€™m sitting on a square writting a letter to you. Youâ€™re a Beautiful City, and Iâ€™m so grateful for everything you have allowed me to experience and discover. Itâ€™s an incredibly intense time, with unprecedented depth of self-awareness, allowing me to identify fears holding me back.</p>

<p>I feel that weâ€™re all afraid, some more than others, but this primary emotion is something we all share. Fear of sickness and death. Fear of the Unknown. Fear of being left behind. Fear of being alone. Fear of missing out. Fear of rejection. Fear of being judged.</p>

<p>With so many fears, itâ€™s not surprising that each and every one of us is a mess, in their very unique and irrepeatable way. And yet, Fear can be overcomed, just like any pattern, no matter how deep, can be rewritten.</p>

<p>For me, the process starts with noticing the Fear, creeping in the deep ocean of the subconscious mind, and bringing it up t the surface of awareness. And then â€“ embrace it. Thatâ€™s the hard part.</p>

<p>Opressing, repressing, surpressing, pretending itâ€™s not there, numbing, distracting, and other clever strategies can work in the short run, but ultimately Fear awaits to be acknowledged head on and embraced, like any other being on this planet.</p>

<p>Once accepted, it looses itâ€™s paralyzing power. allowing for a deep wholehearted hug.</p>

<p>With the heart trully open, no Fear can be.</p>

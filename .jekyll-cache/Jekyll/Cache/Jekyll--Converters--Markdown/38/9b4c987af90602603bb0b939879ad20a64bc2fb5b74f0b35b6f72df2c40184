I"¨<p><strong>This vegan, sugar-free cheesecake is fâ€¦..g perfect.</strong></p>

<p>ðŸš¨ for best results the cake needs 2-4 hours in the freezer before serving.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/7-ingredient-vegan-cheesecakes/" target="_blank">Minimalist Baker</a> ðŸŽ©. Voted the best cake of the Christmas table a few times by my Pico Family (not to be bragging, or anything, just trying to get you to make it)âœ¨</p>

<p>Tools: Blender, Freezer, Mixing Bowl.
Type: Base + Filling + (optional) Topping <br />
 <br /></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> oats (2 cup), drinking coconut milk (1 cup), cocoa (2 tbsp), dates (1 cup), cashew nuts (3 cup), coconut oil (1/2 cup), thick coconut milk (1 cup), lemon (1-2), agave sirup (1 cup),</p>

<p>Optional: peanut butter (1/2 cup) and / or blueberries (1 cup)</p>

<h2 id="base">Base:</h2>

<p>Soak 2 cups of <strong>oats</strong> in <strong>coconut milk  with 2 tbsp **cocoa powder</strong>, then blend with 1 cup of pitted dates. Pour in the cake dish and put into the freezer while you make the filling.</p>

<h2 id="filling">Filling:</h2>

<p>Blend together: 3 cup soaked <strong>cashews</strong> + 1 cup thick <strong>coconut milk</strong> + 1/2 cup melted <strong>coconut oil</strong> + 1-2 <strong>lemons</strong> (taste to adjust) + 1 cup <strong>agave sirup</strong>. Then pour over the base and freeze for 4 hours.</p>

<p>Optionally: blend with blueberries, or peanut butter.</p>

<h2 id="topping">Topping:</h2>

<p>1 spoon of <strong>peanut butter</strong>.</p>

<p>The original recipe says that you can keep it in the fridge for a few days, but I never got to verify that claimâ€”the cake was gone within 24 hours.</p>

I"å<p>The phone life<br />
is definitely not<br />
the life I want to live<br /></p>

<p>Okay, so what is<br />
the life I do want to live,<br />
and, in case it is not<br />
precisely the life I am living,<br />
then why am I not living<br />
the life I want?<br /></p>

<p>The truth is<br />
that I can<br />
and the only thing<br />
stopping me is myself<br />
which is actually a scary thought<br />
because why would I<br />
sabotage myself<br />
and sacrifice my own wellbeing<br />
for other stuff,<br />
from which at least a chunk<br />
is crap.<br /></p>

<p>It is indeed a mystery<br />
and to relieve myself from misery<br />
I am pausing myself right now<br />
to ask:<br /></p>

<p>What is the life I want to live?<br /></p>

<p>And, in case it is not<br />
precisely the life I am living then<br /> 
why is that?<br /></p>

<p>I can change all on a whim<br />
all it takes is to face the storm<br /> 
within.</p>

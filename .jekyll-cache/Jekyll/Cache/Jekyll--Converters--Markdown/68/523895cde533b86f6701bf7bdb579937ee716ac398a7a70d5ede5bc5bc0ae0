I"<p>The content might be king, but if it doesn’t make people come alive then it’s really just another thing to do.</p>

<p>As a facilitator my role is to <strong>catalyse aliveness</strong> and <strong>enable meaningful co-creation</strong>. Being together is precious. Let’s make it count.</p>

<p>✨</p>

<h2 id="facilitation-is-an-art">Facilitation is an Art</h2>

<p>My role is to create a space where people <strong>feel safe to play</strong>.</p>

<p>Through embodying <strong>full presence</strong>, <strong>modelling behaviour</strong>, and <strong>open-hearted connection</strong>, I <strong>tune the group into a harmonious super-organism</strong> encouraging <strong>co-creation of magickal moments and tangible artefacts</strong> from the place of playfulness.</p>

<p><strong>Play is the ultimate flow state</strong>. And I’m all about <strong>Serious Fun</strong>.</p>

  <p>“I’ve made my year in review as always to close this year. Going through my calendar, the series of events, feelings and insights that I had, I realized how much of a great impact your work had on the positive outcome of my year. <strong>I’m slowly changing to become the person I would like to be. You gave me tools for that, by putting your heart in sharing your own life and learnings openly, as a coach, as a mentor, as a person.</strong>”

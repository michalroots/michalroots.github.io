<p><a href="https://gatheringoftribes.earth/" target="_blank">Gathering of Tribes</a> is the meeting point of the regenerative ecosystem. We meet every two years to strengthen our connections, evaluate progress, and accelerate the transition towards regenerative way of living on a planetary scale. This time hosted at <a href="https://labs.thegarden.pt/" target="_blank">the Garden</a>.</p>

<p>It is the place to be.</p>

<p>To help me clarify my <em>personal why</em> of going there I made a list. It turned out to be extensive, resulting in a valid concern - Is it reasonable to do it all?</p>

<p><em>It is not only reasonable</em> - my Wizard self replied - <em>It is necessary</em> üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Frankly - I am done with waiting, ineffective coordination, and doing things that I don‚Äôt find worth doing. <strong>It is time to make good stuff happen and I am more than ready to play my part ‚Äì being a catalyst of change, bringing people together, reducing barriers to act, unlocking creative potential, and inspiring by example.</strong></p>

<p>We‚Äôre all responsible and it is time to act.</p>

<p>To show up fully and hone my pro-facilitation skills I embarked on a quest of (co-)facilitating twelve workshops during four days. As soon as the build of TDF camp was over I jumped into action.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the chronological list, along with the outcome of each session.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Metacrisis</strong> (invited by August) -&gt; a cocreated zine donated to the Library (my fav place in the Gathering)</li>
  <li><strong>Magickal Card Portrait</strong> -&gt; multiple Cards gifted to people and some deep moments of connection</li>
  <li><strong>How to Build A Regenerative Village</strong> -&gt; selling out the first printed edition of the book and strengthening the community around <a href="https://treehousedao.earth/" target="_blank">the book</a></li>
  <li><strong>Storytelling Playback</strong> (invited by <a href="https://yanamori.com/" target="_blank">Yana</a>) -&gt; brainstorm and cardification of a funky interactive theatre</li>
  <li><strong>The Hub</strong> -&gt; making new connections through space design</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://wildwizards.xyz/#journey" target="_blank">Wild Cards Journey</a></strong> -&gt; tears, laughter and beautiful cards</li>
  <li><strong>Sailors Meetup</strong> -&gt; digital connection space for <a href="https://t.me/+HFn4THoqsIE1YTVk" target="_blank">regen sailors</a></li>

  <li><strong>Baptism</strong> -&gt; ceremonial naming of the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/indigoprophet" target="_blank">Indigo Prophet</a></li>
  <li><strong>Spaceholder Mastermind</strong> by <a href="https://www.gaianet.earth/" target="_blank">Gaianet</a> (taking a role) -&gt; cardification &amp; pod hosting</li>

</ul>

<p><em>First session of Cardify Anything</em></p>

<p>On the last day of the Gathering I celebrated the completion of the Twelve with the Thirteenth workshop, combining a few of them into one in a state of the perfect flow.</p>

<p>In the midst of all that I also had a powerful smash-sesh with my epic <a href="https://www.enspiral.com/" target="_blank">Enspiral</a> Business Coach <a href="https://twitter.com/DanAlexiLewis" target="_blank">Dan</a>, and attended six sessions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.nomadfarm.co/" target="_blank">Nomad Farm</a></strong> -&gt; brainstormed nomadic sailing community.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep Time Walk</strong> ‚Äì&gt; put time on Earth into embodied perspective</li>
  <li><strong>Sensitive Sensors</strong> by <a href="https://smarthoods.eco/" target="_blank">Smarthoods</a> -&gt; blew my mind and opened new possibilities to add to my <a href="https://wildwizards.xyz/#journey" target="_blank">Wild Cards Journey</a>.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://eternalforest.earth/" target="_blank">Eternal Forest</a> Academy</strong> ‚Äì&gt; supported an epic forest art &amp; education project.</li>
  <li><strong>Gathering Integration</strong> ‚Äì&gt; taking it all in and processing (note: I didn‚Äôt get to speak with the facilitator, and I feel I should have - she was sooo brilliant! If you read this, please reach out üòâ)</li>
  <li><strong>Contact Massage</strong> from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glo-moss">Glo</a> ‚Äì&gt; learning a brilliant connection technique ü§ç</li>
</ul>

<p>I really wanted to participate in a session hosted by my friends from <a href="https://www.greaterthan.works/" target="_blank">GreaterThan</a> camp and I would have most likely joined the session about the future of the Gathering, but I couldn‚Äôt coordinate it. The Gathering lacked a physical display of the program, keeping it all inside an app, which doesn‚Äôt really work for me - having a phone during events like this has a significant negative impact on my experience and I‚Äôm not willing to compromise on that one. That‚Äôs my one piece of feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Not a biggie. After all, a Wizard is never late. Neither does he or she arrive too early. A Wizard arrives precisely at the right time and at the right place.</strong></p>

<p>On the pic above, the Wizard arrived at the lake to weave some dreams.</p>

<p><strong>The Gathering left me feeling fulfilled, inspired and excited for everything that is to come</strong>. My notebook filled with amazing connections and new collaborations are sprouting all along.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media-wizard-of-the-gathering/audrey-michal-notes.jpg" alt="Notes from the meeting" width="100%" /></p>

<p><strong>I‚Äôve learnt that my energy is endless, because just like you, I am energy.</strong> Whenever tired all that is need is a moment of a high quality recharge - whether by having a nap, cuddle, or dancing wild in the middle of a drum circle. The energy rises again and the Flow continues.</p>

<p>And why host 13 workshops in the first place?</p>

<p>Because it‚Äôs fun. Because it‚Äôs possible. Because it‚Äôs the best contribution I could have made to the Gathering.</p>

<p><strong>There is no time to wait to deploy your gifts. Whatever is the piece of the puzzle that you are called to build - the time is Now.</strong></p>

<p>Or, in the words of my <a href="https://t.me/brianmongo" target="_blank">Shaman</a>:</p>

<p>What‚Äôs up for me in this next months?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I‚Äôm hosting a book writing mastermind in Switzerland about Semi-Nomadic Lifestyle (<a href="https://x.com/michalkorzonek/status/1840820973081088202" target="_blank">live documentation twitter thread</a>), come visit on the Open Day on the 19th of October</li>
  <li>Completing my commercial officer license for sailing ships up to 500 tonnes</li>
  <li>Organising a sailing expedition to Antarctica ‚õµÔ∏èüßä</li>
  <li>Another book writing in Switzerland in April (topic TBC)</li>
  <li>and more - sailing trips, writing 100 books in a month (yup), making a musical, growing <a href="https://www.enspiral.com/" target="_blank">Enspiral</a> Europe. The possibilities are endless, and <strong>I‚Äôm quite done with not doing things that are both exciting and terrifying</strong>. That‚Äôs the perfect signpost towards an epic growth curve.</li>
</ul>

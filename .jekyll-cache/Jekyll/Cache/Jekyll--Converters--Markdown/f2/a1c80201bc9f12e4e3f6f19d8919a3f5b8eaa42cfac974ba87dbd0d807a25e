<p>WTF is semi-nomadism? A group of 14 semi-nomads co-created this book during a month-long mastermind. With 3 hours of card play per day and a total of 867 cards we have distiled hands-on experiences of semi-nomadic lifestyles into a 190 page illustrated book.</p>

<p>Embark with us on an exploratory dance to uncover what it means to be a semi-nomad. Weâ€™ll journey through varied landscapes, dive deep into meaningful insights, and engage in practical how-toâ€™s.</p>

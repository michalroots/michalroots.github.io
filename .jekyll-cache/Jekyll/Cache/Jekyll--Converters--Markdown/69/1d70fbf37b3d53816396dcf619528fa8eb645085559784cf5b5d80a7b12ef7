I"š<p>Iâ€™m walking back into myself<br />
after taking a moment to look<br />
far far far far far away<br /></p>

<p>seeing the stars brightening<br /> 
me with their light<br /></p>

<p>noticing parts<br />
oh so many parts<br /></p>

<p>they are all here with me<br />
waiting to have their turn at speaking<br /></p>

<p>and frankly, itâ€™s quite awkward<br />
to hear all of them at once<br /></p>

<p>they seem quite contradictory<br />
some of them have a very good sense of humour<br />
but others are just fucking angry all the time<br />
and you canâ€™t have much of a conversation<br />
or at least not an intelligible one<br /></p>

<p>But here I am sitting with all of them<br />
and itâ€™s fine<br /></p>

<p>itâ€™s okay<br /></p>

<p>Iâ€™m alright<br /></p>

<p>Iâ€™m brightened by light<br />
and it feels good to be standing here<br /> 
watching the ocean fade into the night <br />
under the stars<br /></p>

<p>they are so bright the stars<br /></p>

<p><em>Walking Home is inspired by a moment with a friend, when we realised that in spite of what numerous demagogic voices of reason inside each of us claim sometimes: it is actually fine.</em></p>

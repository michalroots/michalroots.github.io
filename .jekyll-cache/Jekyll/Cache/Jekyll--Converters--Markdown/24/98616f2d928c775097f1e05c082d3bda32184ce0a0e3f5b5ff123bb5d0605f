I"<p>Context:</p>

<p>After three years together, my Lover needed space to explore who she is on her own. We loved each other very much, but while Iâ€™ve had the blessing of self-discovery travels for many years, she moved to live with me straight from living with her parents. It was painful to let her go, but I knew the importance of the journey that was calling her soul.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a rap song I made for her.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYvQpMGdfto" target="_blank">youtube video</a></p>

<p>ðŸ’œ</p>

<p>From the very beginning  <br />
To the very end of my soul  <br />
Here are some words for you: <br /></p>

<p>Hello!  <br />
Are you there? <br /></p>

<p>On the other side of this planet,  <br />
Living your life, walking the path that is in front of youâ€¦  <br />
Is there still space in your backpack to fit my heart  <br />
Which keeps beating with Energy  <br />
Which I used to share with you everyday?<br /></p>

<p>Are you okay?<br /></p>

<p>So many questions,  <br />
But I guess it is to be expected of me.  <br />
After all I used to get the answers immediately  <br />
Every time when I felt you next to me Breathing,  <br />
Painting the air with sounds of love and joy  <br />
And every other thing that we have experienced  <br />
Since our souls touched for the very first time.  <br />
When we still didnâ€™t know each other.  <br />
Before I drew a path into your soul  <br />
Wanting so much to get to know you  <br />
And explore if you and me  <br />
Can share Something  <br />
Which will change how we understand Love  <br />
Until this very breath.<br /></p>

<p>Can we still connect on the same level  <br />
Or beyond? Outgrow what we used to know  <br />
With no before and no future  <br />
Only the present of Today  <br />
When I think of you,  <br />
When I miss you  <br />
When I am so happy to be apart to realize  <br />
That you are such a huge part of my life.<br /></p>

<p>And my soul and my thoughts  <br />
And my whole body is happy walking on its own path  <br />
Knowing that connection which we have  <br />
Is the most significant connection  <br />
Which I have experienced in the past until now.<br /></p>

<p>And the future is always open  <br />
And I hope that our paths will meet  <br />
And our souls will touch and see each other.<br /></p>

<p>And who knows?  <br />
Maybe we will grow?  <br />
Maybe we will grow together?  <br />
I wish I could know, but thatâ€™s a trap  <br />
And at this very moment  <br />
<strong>I am Here and you are  <br />
Somewhere Else understanding  <br />
Who we are when we are apart  <br />
So if we ever get back  <br />
We will only be stronger  <br />
And more loving.</strong> <br /></p>

<p>â€¦<br /></p>

<p>Who knows?  <br />
We will have to live and see.<br /></p>

<p>Right?<br /></p>

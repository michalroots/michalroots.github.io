<p><strong>Why books?</strong></p>

<p>Books are far from dead. They are <strong>tangible artefacts distilling the vibe, knowledge, and work of your organisation</strong> into a physical item sending ripples into the world.</p>

<p>The physical nature of books ensures creative constraints helping you <strong>focus on the most important information to communicate</strong>. There‚Äôs nothing stopping you from turning it into an infinitely expanding digital ecosystem afterwards. Still - a book is a book. It just feels different than a website, doesn‚Äôt it?</p>

<p>This is not <em>just</em> about the book, though‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>ADD GROUP VIBES IMAGE</p>

<p>There is a very tangible magic in the air that emerges when people <strong>gather to create something together</strong> in the same physical space. We are after that magic, topped up with a very special ingredient:</p>

<p><strong>Serious Fun</strong>.</p>

<p>Play is at the core of the creative process I offer. <strong>Play opens up limitless creativity, removes performance anxiety, and creates the unique shared experience</strong> that will transform your team into a humming super-organism. The book that will emerge from that state will reflect that.</p>

<p>Shall we make yours?</p>

<p>Books:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://treehousedao.earth" target="_blank">How to Build A Regenerative Village</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/regen-village-cover.jpg" alt="Cover of the book" /></p>

<p><strong>This 174 pages illustrated book was co-created by a multidisciplinary team of 28 regenerative pioneers during an 11-day mastermind</strong>, which I had the pleasure of facilitating.</p>

<p>It weaves together lineages of wisdom and practical experience from a worldwide tribe of regenerative village builders - serving as an emergent base of knowledge, as well as actionable blueprint, encouraging the <strong>transition towards a regenerative way of living</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>I‚Äôve documented the creation process</strong> live in this <a href="https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1565240255564980225" target="_blank">twitter thread</a>.</p>

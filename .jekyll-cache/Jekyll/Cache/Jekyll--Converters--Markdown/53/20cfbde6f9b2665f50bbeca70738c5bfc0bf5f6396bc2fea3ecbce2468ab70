I"¡<p>Context:</p>

<p><em>Minimalist Journaling System</em> (which I eventually rebranded as <em>Infinity Squares</em>) is a journaling practice I developed to build consistency with habits that matter.</p>

<p>Over 1400+ days of consistent use, I discovered that squares are much more than just a tool for habits. Instead they are an <strong>intuitive journaling operating system, a visual representation of how your life unfolds, and a daily ritual of grounding and re-alignment.</strong></p>

<p>Infinity Squares is the core practice in my life, and has impacted hundreds of people who decided to implement this method into their journals.</p>

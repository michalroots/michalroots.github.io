I"ì<p>If I die today <br />
donâ€™t miss me 
Iâ€™ve had a wonderful life <br />
and even if it finished abruptly <br />
Iâ€™m so happy to have lived it <br />
and now depart.</p>

<p>I had to die one day anyway <br />
and today is a good day <br />
like any other.</p>

<p>There were things I wanted to do, <br />
and important words to say, <br />
but, I guess, <br />
I wonâ€™t have the opportunity. <br />
Not in this life anyway.</p>

<p>Now Iâ€™m gone <br />
and what is left is space, <br />
empty, <br />
that Iâ€™m leaving for you.</p>

<p>This space, that I occupied in your life,<br />
wether big or tiny, is my gift to you.</p>

<p>I wish you to use it well. <br />
Let it be the most fertile soil <br />
and a breath of new life <br />
for whatâ€™s the most meaningful<br />
for you to emerge.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll keep sending you rays of eternal love and joy <br />
from wherever Iâ€™ll be next. <br />
Thereâ€™s no need to miss me. <br />
Just enjoy the space.</p>

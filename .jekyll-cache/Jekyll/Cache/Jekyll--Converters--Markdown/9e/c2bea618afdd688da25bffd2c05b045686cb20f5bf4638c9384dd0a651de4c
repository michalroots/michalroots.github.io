I"<p>Note: I failed this experiment üôÅ It‚Äôs 2023 and I‚Äôm still using Google.</p>

<p>2022 is the time to finally ditch Google from my personal and professional life, as much as possible.</p>

<p>Why? Because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I don‚Äôt align with its values</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm disturbed by the insane power that a single corporation has</li>
  <li>There are plenty of functional and awesome alternatives</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm done sacrificing my values for convenience</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words: <strong>I can‚Äôt bullshit myself anymore that it‚Äôs too hard. It just takes some time.</strong></p>

<p>If you need more convincing on why ditch Google, there are some resources at the end of this post.</p>

<h2 id="using-google-is-a-habit">Using Google is a habit</h2>

<p>As I embarked on this journey, I noticed that <strong>quitting google is very similar to quitting a bad habit</strong>. Over numerous year of interacting with the internet, I have conditioned myself to default to google, and it‚Äôs not easy at all to give it up.</p>

<p>This is a powerful realisation, because I am a certified habit building coach, and I have worked with clients (and myself) in the area of habit building for quite some time. This means I know exactly how to approach this situation effectively, or at least give it my best shot.</p>

<p><strong>The critical idea in habit-building is to steadily keep moving forward with a tiny habit, rather than overcommitting.</strong> This is why I don‚Äôt intend to migrate away from google in a week or so, but rather see it as an ongoing process, which I‚Äôm going to document here.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs my (ongoing) process:</p>

<p align="center">‚úÖ</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="google-chrome">Google Chrome</h2>
<p>I always preferred <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>. <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a> is cool too (I use it on mobile). Easy peasy.</p>

<h2 id="google-search">Google Search</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mojeek.com/" target="_blank">Mojeek</a> + <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a></p>

<p>I swapped to <em>DuckDuckGo</em> years ago and it used to be my default search engine until I read this <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/private-search-engine/" target="_blank">amazing article</a> exploring private search engines. Turns out DDG stores some information, plus it is US-based, which doesn‚Äôt inspire my confidence at all.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve decided to move to <em>Mojeek</em> as my primary search, and supplement it with DDG whenever necessary.</p>

<h2 id="youtube-for-music">Youtube for music</h2>
<p><a href="http://spotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify</a></p>

<p>I‚Äôve quit youtube for music when I joined <em>Spotify</em>. I have a family premium account. Other alternatives I like are <a href="https://soundcloud.com" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> and <a href="https://bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a> . The latter is a great way of supporting artists I love financially and downloading music for offline use, which will come in handy when I move to a sailboat ‚õµÔ∏è.</p>

<p align="center">‚è≥</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/" target="_blank">Cryptdrive</a></p>

<p>I love cryptdrive and it was a no-brainer to switch. I‚Äôm using it for all new files, but I still need to migrate documents from Google Drive.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is one of these things that have a tendency of sending me down a rabbit hole of over organising folders etc. I admit my drive is a combination of well organised <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/" target="_blank">PARA system</a> and a folder with all the mess that I made over the years, which I never got to really clean up.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs worth noting here that I‚Äôm redesigning my computer experience for <em>offline-first</em> and <em><a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">obsidian</a>-centered</em>.</p>

<h2 id="gmail">Gmail</h2>
<p><a href="https://protonmail.com/" target="_blank">Protonmail</a></p>

<p>After going on a rabbit hole of research triggered by this <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/email/secure/" target="_blank">article</a>  about secure emails, I reached a conclusion that there is no fully private option on the market. Even Protonmail and Tutanota have serious issues.</p>

<p>After considering different pros and cons, I made my decision to go with protonmail. It‚Äôs not perfect, but definitely better than gmail.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is where the migration becomes tricky.</p>

<p>1) All my digital world relies on multiple @gmail addresses and the process of moving to Proton is essentially an opportunity to practice one of the virtues I‚Äôm not so good at ‚Äì patience.</p>

<p>2) My recovering-perfectionist mind wants me to create a perfect combination of email addresses, for personal, work and secret purposes.</p>

<p>The habit-building work begins here. I created my free protonmail account and started using it for creating new accounts, subscriptions etc. I‚Äôll eventually move to a paid plan, as I ditch my business google accounts.</p>

<h2 id="google-calendar">Google Calendar</h2>
<p>Proton Calendar</p>

<p>There are three problems with Proton Calendar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the design on mobile is quite poor for my use case, and since I have to use the dedicated app I can‚Äôt fix it with a third-party app</li>
  <li>development cycles in Proton are ridiculously long.</li>
  <li>can it work with calendly or other scheduling tool?</li>
</ul>

<p>For now I started migrating some of my events there, and I‚Äôll continue the process over time.</p>

<h2 id="youtube">Youtube</h2>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è research phase: <a href="https://d.tube/" target="_blank">D.tube</a> and <a href="https://odysee.com/" target="_blank">Odysee</a></p>

<p>I just caught myself automatically going to youtube to look for something (LYT obsidian videos), which yet again brings me back to the idea that quitting Google is like quitting a bad habit.</p>

<p>I noticed though, so I went on to try alternatives. <em>Dtube</em> gave me nothing, but <em>Odysee</em> shown more promising results.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm still not convinced to go with it and migrate all my youtube content there, but I am considering it.</p>

<h2 id="google-photos">Google Photos</h2>

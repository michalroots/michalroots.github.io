I"|<p>The content might be king, but if it doesn’t make people come alive then it’s really just another thing to do.</p>

<p>As a facilitator my role is to <strong>activate the energy in the space</strong> and <strong>help people come alive</strong>. Being together is precious. Let’s make some magick!</p>

<p>✨</p>

<p>My role is to create a space where people <strong>feel safe to play</strong>.</p>

<p>Through embodying <strong>full presence</strong>, <strong>modelling behaviour</strong>, and <strong>open-hearted connection</strong>, I <strong>tune the group into a harmonious super-organism</strong> encouraging <strong>co-creation of magickal moments and tangible artefacts</strong> from the place of playfulness. <strong>Play is the ultimate flow state</strong>. And I’m all about <strong>Serious Fun</strong>.</p>

<p>In my work I combine over a <strong>decade of experience</strong> with <strong>facilitation in diverse contexts</strong> and <strong>multidisciplinary arts</strong> (performing, visual, narrative, and more):</p>

I"¸<p><strong>I (co-)create experiences, spaces and events where magic happens.</strong></p>
<p>
ğŸŒ€
</p>
<p>Gatherings, immersive performances, cohort based courses, parties, exhibitions, sailing trips, sharing circles, workshops, trainings, retreats, weddings â€¦ you name it.</p>

<p>My personal <em>ikigai</em> is to <strong>bring people together and hold space for relational transformation</strong>. Relational = in relationship with other people and the world around us.</p>
<p>
ğŸŒ³
</p>
<p>It all started with my mother bringing me to a winter retreat of a theatre group at the age of one (thank you mum!), which escalated into a <strong>Film and Media degree</strong>, and numerous <strong>exhibitions, performances, and art experiences.</strong></p>

<p>In parallel, at the age of eighteen I started <strong>organising events and facilitating teams</strong> on international exchanges and <em>European Youth Parliament</em> sessions. Since then, Iâ€™ve been <strong>practicing the future of work by co-creating within <em>Enspiral</em>, <em>Traditional Dream Factory</em></strong>, <em>Honeyboom</em>, <em>Lethally Harmless Productions</em> and other wonderful projects and organisations. Iâ€™m a <strong>microsolidarity community weaver and catalyst</strong> in Pico Island (which is my home for most of the year), working towards Azores Regenerative Network. Iâ€™m also: a <strong>certified habit coach</strong> -&gt; dream big, start small, make it happen.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a big fan of <strong>learning by doing</strong> and my professional curiosity lies in <strong>integrating transformational experiences</strong>: <em>how to carry forward the energy and insight from a transformational experience, after itâ€™s over?</em></p>

<p>
â˜€ï¸
</p>
<p><strong>My work is inspired by heart-to-heart connections, nature and playfulness</strong>. I love contact improvisation, hiking for hours, building structures from wood, seeing a spark of joy in someones eyes, and sailing at night under star-covered sky. These moments of awe make me feel alive and fuel my aspiration:</p>

<p><strong>Letâ€™s co-create a beautiful world where all Beings can thrive</strong>.</p>

<p>Thank you for Being âœ¨ <br />

<p>A friend from Traditional Dream Factory shared with me recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œso nice to have you part of these circles. I honor your being &amp; presence! making things deeper and lighter at the same timeâ€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It touched me deeply.</p>

<p>Here are a few other comments about my work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIâ€™ve made my year in review as always to close this year. Going through my calendar, the series of events, feelings and insights that I had, I realized how much of a great impact your work had on the positive outcome of my year. <strong>Iâ€™m slowly changing to become the person I would like to be. You gave me tools for that, by putting your heart in sharing your own life and learnings openly, as a coach, as a mentor, as a person.</strong>â€œ<br />
â€“ Flora Koczka; <em>Wise</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThe way I move, breathe, see and hear changed drastically already and it all started through realising I am feeling disconnected and need to sense into my feet. So small but so incredibly powerful. <strong>I am beyond grateful for you all helping me realising how things can change and to what extend.</strong><br />
â€“ Alina Manko; <em>Enspiral &amp; Open Collective</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œAfter reading your newsletter this week I wanted to encourage you about the wonderful journey I see you following. (â€¦) <strong>I do see a genuine heart wanting to help and serve people. Your life choices are influencing others to live a more mindful and wholesome lifestyle</strong>.
â€“ Claire Ducharme</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œ<strong>The Routine Bootcamp was a very impactful way to reflect on my routines and get the support I needed to change them</strong>. Sharing with others helped me understand my needs better, and helped with accountability and motivation. This was such a great way to get over roadblocks and improve my life!â€
â€“ Irem Tumer, UNFPA</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œI am DEEPLY grateful for your program. <strong>I am on day 140 of yoga daily and day 74 of meditating every day.</strong> Itâ€™s making such a difference in EVERYTHING.â€<br />
â€“ Cathy Hutchison; <em>Idibri &amp; Your Visual Journal</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThe structure of the calls is highly effective. The facilitation brilliantly mixes different ways to participate so that whether you are creative or logical, extroverted or introverted, quick to react or slower to process, there is space for you. <strong>I find these calls so valuable that I have adapted the format to use with the group that I am mentoring.</strong>â€
â€” Cathy Hutchison, Founder at Your Visual Journal</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œWhen we formed this Writersâ€™ Smart Pod I did not expect that our first six weeks of Zoom meetings would be so insightful, energy-giving, and productive. <strong>You designed the program with enough flexibility to meet our particular needs and working preferences, and the right amount of structure and guidance for us to form an effective cohort to move our projects forward. More important, as you have pointed out, are the relationships we have formed.</strong></p>

  <p>Iâ€™m happy with what Iâ€™ve produced and the breakthroughs Iâ€™ve had. Now I wouldnâ€™t want to continue with my project without these guys on the path with me. <strong>This is the most valuable and satisfying working group Iâ€™ve been a part of in a long time. I heartily encourage anyone who is thinking of working with you to just do it</strong>, for the creative and productive value and for the positive experience.â€
â€“ Deanna Vogt; Executive Coach</p>

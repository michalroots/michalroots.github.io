<p><strong>Who are you sailing with defines your adventure.</strong></p>

<p>I’m an experience designer, facilitator, and a professional sailor. I curate the crew to ensure high sense of harmony, friendship, and fun. We learn how to <strong>sail the ship together, witness awe-inspiring nature, and turn dreams into memories</strong> that will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>I am an Enkhuizeer Zeevaartschool graduate, training to become an officer on sailing ships up to 500 tonnes. I have a full set of professional certificates, including STCW Basic Safety, First Aid, and RYA SRC.</p>

<p>I’ve sailed with one-of-a-kind ships like Tecla, Twister, Grayhound, Chateauroux and Atyla, as well as Azorean whaling boats, holopuni sailing canoes, and modern yachts.</p>

## Your vision, ship-ified.

Do you have a concept that wants to live at sea?  
  
I help facilitators, leaders, and creatives shape their vision into seaworthy voyages – and bring them to life onboard. I will help you translate your idea into the reality of a ship, connect you to the right vessel, and support you as a co-facilitator. From transformational retreats to teambuilding events, the sea will make your event unforgettable.

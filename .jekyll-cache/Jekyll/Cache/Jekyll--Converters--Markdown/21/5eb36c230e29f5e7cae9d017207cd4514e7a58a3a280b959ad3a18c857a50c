I"¢<p>In June 2021 I designed and co-hosted our first community gathering in Pico Island.</p>

<p><strong>The intention was to build connection between people committed to being in Pico for the long-term, weaving social fabric and opening up possibilities for future projects to emerge.</strong></p>

<p>The gathering was a direct result of our Sharing Circle and is intended to act as a heartbeat for our congregation. In many ways, it felt like a climax of the first chapter of our microsolidarity work in the island.</p>

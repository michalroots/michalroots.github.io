[Gathering of Tribes](https://gatheringoftribes.earth/){:target="_blank"} is the meeting point of the regenerative ecosystem. We meet every two years to strengthen our connections, evaluate progress, and accelerate the transition towards regenerative way of living on a planetary scale. This time hosted at [the Garden](https://labs.thegarden.pt/){:target="_blank"}.

It is the place to be.

To help me clarify my *personal why* of going there I made a list. It turned out to be extensive, resulting in a valid concern - Is it reasonable to do it all?

*It is not only reasonable* - my Wizard self replied - *It is necessary* üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Why?

Frankly - I am done with waiting, ineffective coordination, and doing things that I don't find worth doing. **It is time to make good stuff happen and I am more than ready to play my part ‚Äì being a catalyst of change, bringing people together, reducing barriers to act, unlocking creative potential, and inspiring by example.**

We're all responsible and it is time to act.

To show up fully and hone my pro-facilitation skills I embarked on a quest of (co-)facilitating twelve workshops during four days. As soon as the build of TDF camp was over I jumped into action.

Here's the chronological list, along with the outcome of each session.

- **Metacrisis** (invited by August) -> a cocreated zine donated to the Library (my fav place in the Gathering)
- **Magickal Card Portrait** -> multiple Cards gifted to people and some deep moments of connection
- **How to Build A Regenerative Village** -> selling out the first printed edition of the book and strengthening the community around [the book](https://treehousedao.earth/){:target="_blank"}
- **Storytelling Playback** (invited by [Yana](https://yanamori.com/){:target="_blank"}) -> brainstorm and cardification of a funky interactive theatre
- **The Hub** -> making new connections through space design
- **[Wild Cards Journey](https://wildwizards.xyz/#journey){:target="_blank"}** -> tears, laughter and beautiful cards
- **Sailors Meetup** -> digital connection space for [regen sailors](https://t.me/+HFn4THoqsIE1YTVk){:target="_blank"}
- **Cardify Anything** -> a connection game, an app design, a critical card culture building block, and training another cohort of card wizards.
- **Baptism** -> ceremonial naming of the [Indigo Prophet](https://soundcloud.com/indigoprophet){:target="_blank"}
- **Spaceholder Mastermind** by [Gaianet](https://www.gaianet.earth/){:target="_blank"} (taking a role) -> cardification & pod hosting
- **Boulder Garden Blind Path** -> improved nightvision and pathfinding skills in the wild
- **Prompt Human Intelligence** -> funky interactions & playtime

*First session of Cardify Anything*

On the last day of the Gathering I celebrated the completion of the Twelve with the Thirteenth workshop, combining a few of them into one in a state of the perfect flow.

In the midst of all that I also had a powerful smash-sesh with my epic [Enspiral](https://www.enspiral.com/){:target="_blank"} Business Coach [Dan](https://twitter.com/DanAlexiLewis){:target="_blank"}, and attended six sessions:

- **[Nomad Farm](https://www.nomadfarm.co/){:target="_blank"}** -> brainstormed nomadic sailing community.
- **Deep Time Walk** ‚Äì> put time on Earth into embodied perspective
- **Sensitive Sensors** by [Smarthoods](https://smarthoods.eco/){:target="_blank"} -> blew my mind and opened new possibilities to add to my [Wild Cards Journey](https://wildwizards.xyz/#journey){:target="_blank"}.
- **[Eternal Forest](https://eternalforest.earth/){:target="_blank"} Academy** ‚Äì> supported an epic forest art & education project.
- **Gathering Integration** ‚Äì> taking it all in and processing (note: I didn't get to speak with the facilitator, and I feel I should have - she was sooo brilliant! If you read this, please reach out üòâ)
- **Contact Massage** from [Glo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glo-moss) ‚Äì> learning a brilliant connection technique ü§ç

I really wanted to participate in a session hosted by my friends from [GreaterThan](https://www.greaterthan.works/){:target="_blank"} camp and I would have most likely joined the session about the future of the Gathering, but I couldn't coordinate it. The Gathering lacked a physical display of the program, keeping it all inside an app, which doesn't really work for me - having a phone during events like this has a significant negative impact on my experience and I'm not willing to compromise on that one. That's my one piece of feedback.

**Not a biggie. After all, a Wizard is never late. Neither does he or she arrive too early. A Wizard arrives precisely at the right time and at the right place.**

On the pic above, the Wizard arrived at the lake to weave some dreams.

**The Gathering left me feeling fulfilled, inspired and excited for everything that is to come**. My notebook filled with amazing connections and new collaborations are sprouting all along.

![Notes from the meeting](/assets/media-wizard-of-the-gathering/audrey-michal-notes.jpg){:width="100%"}

**I've learnt that my energy is endless, because just like you, I am energy.** Whenever tired all that is need is a moment of a high quality recharge - whether by having a nap, cuddle, or dancing wild in the middle of a drum circle. The energy rises again and the Flow continues.

And why host 13 workshops in the first place? 

Because it's fun. Because it's possible. Because it's the best contribution I could have made to the Gathering.

**There is no time to wait to deploy your gifts. Whatever is the piece of the puzzle that you are called to build - the time is Now.**

Or, in the words of my [Shaman](https://t.me/brianmongo){:target="_blank"}:

What's up for me in this next months?

- I'm hosting a book writing mastermind in Switzerland about Semi-Nomadic Lifestyle ([live documentation twitter thread](https://x.com/michalkorzonek/status/1840820973081088202){:target="_blank"}), come visit on the Open Day on the 19th of October
- Completing my commercial officer license for sailing ships up to 500 tonnes
- Organising a sailing expedition to Antarctica ‚õµÔ∏èüßä
- Another book writing in Switzerland in April (topic TBC)
- and more - sailing trips, writing 100 books in a month (yup), making a musical, growing [Enspiral](https://www.enspiral.com/){:target="_blank"} Europe. The possibilities are endless, and **I'm quite done with not doing things that are both exciting and terrifying**. That's the perfect signpost towards an epic growth curve. 

If you want to follow my journey I invite you to read my [Moonly Reviews](https://michalkorzonek.substack.com/){:target="_blank"}, peak into my [microblog on telegram](https://t.me/sailorwizard){:target="_blank"}, or interact with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek){:target="_blank"}.

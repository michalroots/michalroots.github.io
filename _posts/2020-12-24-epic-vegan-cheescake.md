**This vegan, sugar-free cheesecake is fucking perfect.**

ðŸš¨ for best results the cake needs 2-4 hours in the freezer before serving.

Inspired by [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/7-ingredient-vegan-cheesecakes/){:target="_blank"} ðŸŽ©. Voted the best cake of the Christmas table a few times by my Pico Family (not to be bragging, or anything, just trying to get you to make it)âœ¨

Tools: Blender, Freezer, Mixing Bowl.
Type: Base + Filling + (optional) Topping <br>
 <br>

**Ingredients:** oats (2 cup), drinking coconut milk (1 cup), cocoa (2 tbsp), dates (1 cup), cashew nuts (3 cup), coconut oil (1/2 cup), thick coconut milk (1 cup), lemon (1-2), agave sirup (1 cup), 

Optional: peanut butter (1/2 cup) and / or blueberries (1 cup)


## Base:

Soak 2 cups of **oats** in **coconut milk  with 2 tbsp **cocoa powder**, then blend with 1 cup of pitted dates. Pour in the cake dish and put into the freezer while you make the filling.

## Filling:

Blend together: 3 cup soaked **cashews** + 1 cup thick **coconut milk** + 1/2 cup melted **coconut oil** + 1-2 **lemons** (taste to adjust) + 1 cup **agave sirup**. Then pour over the base and freeze for 4 hours.

Optionally: blend with blueberries, or peanut butter.

## Topping:

1 spoon of **peanut butter**.

The original recipe says that you can keep it in the fridge for a few days, but I never got to verify that claimâ€”the cake was gone within 24 hours.

If I die today <br>
don't miss me 
I've had a wonderful life <br>
and even if it finished abruptly <br>
I'm so happy to have lived it <br>
and now depart.

I had to die one day anyway <br>
and today is a good day <br>
like any other.

There were things I wanted to do, <br>
and important words to say, <br>
but, I guess, <br>
I won't have the opportunity. <br>
Not in this life anyway.

Now I'm gone <br>
and what is left is space, <br>
empty, <br>
that I'm leaving for you.

This space, that I occupied in your life,<br>
wether big or tiny, is my gift to you.

I wish you to use it well. <br>
Let it be the most fertile soil <br>
and a breath of new life <br>
for what's the most meaningful<br>
for you to emerge.

I'll keep sending you rays of eternal love and joy <br>
from wherever I'll be next. <br>
There's no need to miss me. <br>
Just enjoy the space.

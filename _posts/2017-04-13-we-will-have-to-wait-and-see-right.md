Context: 

After three years together, my Lover needed space to explore who she is on her own. We loved each other very much, but while I've had the blessing of self-discovery travels for many years, she moved to live with me straight from living with her parents. It was painful to let her go, but I knew the importance of the journey that was calling her soul.

Here's a rap song I made for her.

From the very beginning  <br>
To the very end of my soul  <br>
Here are some words for you: <br>

Hello!  <br>
Are you there? <br>

On the other side of this planet,  <br>
Living your life, walking the path that is in front of youâ€¦  <br>
Is there still space in your backpack to fit my heart  <br>
Which keeps beating with Energy  <br>
Which I used to share with you everyday?<br>

Are you okay?<br>

So many questions,  <br>
But I guess it is to be expected of me.  <br>
After all I used to get the answers immediately  <br>
Every time when I felt you next to me Breathing,  <br>
Painting the air with sounds of love and joy  <br>
And every other thing that we have experienced  <br>
Since our souls touched for the very first time.  <br>
When we still didnâ€™t know each other.  <br>
Before I drew a path into your soul  <br>
Wanting so much to get to know you  <br>
And explore if you and me  <br>
Can share Something  <br>
Which will change how we understand Love  <br>
Until this very breath.<br>

Can we still connect on the same level  <br>
Or beyond? Outgrow what we used to know  <br>
With no before and no future  <br>
Only the present of Today  <br>
When I think of you,  <br>
When I miss you  <br>
When I am so happy to be apart to realize  <br>
That you are such a huge part of my life.<br>

And my soul and my thoughts  <br>
And my whole body is happy walking on its own path  <br>
Knowing that connection which we have  <br>
Is the most significant connection  <br>
Which I have experienced in the past until now.<br>

And the future is always open  <br>
And I hope that our paths will meet  <br>
And our souls will touch and see each other.<br>

And who knows?  <br>
Maybe we will grow?  <br>
Maybe we will grow together?  <br>
I wish I could know, but thatâ€™s a trap  <br>
And at this very moment  <br>
**I am Here and you are  <br>
Somewhere Else understanding  <br>
Who we are when we are apart  <br>
So if we ever get back  <br>
We will only be stronger  <br>
And more loving.** <br>

â€¦<br>

Who knows?  <br>
We will have to live and see.<br>

Right?<br>

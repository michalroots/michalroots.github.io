I'm here with you<br>
holding space<br>
curiously patiently<br>
getting to know you<br>
and yet <br>
I'm loosing myself<br> 
in seeking connection<br>
and somehow forget <br>
to take a breath<br>
and ask<br>

instead<br>
I speak from the heart<br>
opening up <br>
yet taking space<br> 
that I wish to hold<br>
letting myself unfold<br>
into the night<br>
combining your essence<br>
with my luminescence<br>
so bright<br>

eyes close <br>
eyes meet <br>
we breathe<br>

you're my guide<br> 
my teacher<br>
my mirror<br>

making me aware<br> 
of uncomfortable truths<br>
for which I'm grateful<br>

I'm with you and them <br>
and all the questions <br>
with no comprehension<br>
floating around<br>
yet with courage anew<br>
drawing closer to you<br>
timelessly suspended <br>
our fears befriended<br>
witnessing a moment<br>
of blossoming<br>

I'm here with you
holding space
curiously patiently
getting to know you
and yet 
I'm loosing myself 
in seeking connection
and somehow forget 
to take a breath
and ask

instead
I speak from the heart
opening up 
yet taking space 
that I wish to hold
letting myself unfold
into the night
combining your essence
with my luminescence
so bright

eyes close 
eyes meet 
we breathe

you're my guide 
my teacher
my mirror

making me aware 
of uncomfortable truths
for which I'm grateful

I'm with you and them 
and all the questions 
with no comprehension
floating around
yet with courage anew
drawing closer to you
timelessly suspended 
our fears befriended
witnessing a moment
of blossoming

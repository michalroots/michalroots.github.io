Context: 

Back in Summer 2021 I felt a call to ditch the comforts of living in a house and moved to a Magical Forest on an ocean cliff.

Sinking into the sounds of trees and waves every night brought up a lot of emotions and internal processes, which I decided to channel into heartfelt poems.

I'd like to compile it all into a small booklet with illustrations one day, but for now enjoy the raw words, as they came straight from the heart into the pages of my journal.

Context: I've had a pleasure to facilitate a **community weaving workshop** in Pico's closest neighbour - Faial island. This marks a significant step on the **journey towards co-creating Azores Regenerative Network**.

Magic: Bringing people together in an island and holding space for them to verbalise their dreams to each other and find people to manifest their dreams together with.

My Role: workshop design, facilitation

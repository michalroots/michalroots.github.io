When a couple of beautiful Friends of mine, Bruno and Vera, told me that they could not think of anyone else to perform their wedding ceremony, I felt deeply honoured.

I'm looking forward to performing more Wedding ceremonies (and other ceremonies of different shapes and sizes). If you'd like me to hold space for you, [get in touch](web/enspiral-europe-handbook/about.md#contact){:target="_blank"}.

Context: I wrote this text while at sea (original scan at the end), a couple of days after departing from Edinburgh, which used to be my Home for seven years, and it still does feel like my hometown somehow. 

Back then, I sailed into a new chapter of my life, which funny enough is now about to end with another [sailing](/sailing) adventure taking me to whatever awaits next.

I'm in the process of recording this text as a spoken-word-music collaboration with [João Moreira aka Instil](https://instil.bandcamp.com/album/wide-spectrum-of-beautiful-chaos).

<p>⛵️</p>

Time is gone<br>
and along with the sea<br>
my heart is beating<br>
setting the tone<br>
for discovery<br>

I'm floating and believing<br>
That what I still can't see<br>
Is right there<br>
in front of me<br>
waiting patiently<br>
until I'm ready <br>
to notice.<br>

I'm gone<br>
and I'm here<br>
the same,<br>
but always different.<br>
and it's hard to put this feeling into words, <br>
so I convince myself that<br>
perhaps there is no point<br>
in doing so.<br>
And I float<br>

on words words words<br>
that matter not<br>
sailing my desires<br>
towards true north<br>
fully aligned <br>
with this present moment<br>

What a bliss!<br>

And I am grateful for every breath and sound <br>
every passing wave we found<br>
gently caressing the hull <br>
of this sweet abyss.<br>

The Sun is about to kiss<br>
the horizon, bringing yet another night<br>
at sea<br>

My soul is singing peacefully<br>
with sweet melodies<br>
of tranquility<br>
I now found<br>

There is so much space around! <br>
So much to fill with joy<br>
and birds are calling us down<br>

There is so much to witness!<br>

There is so much life around! <br>
And our little boat is an integral part<br> 
of the infinite vastness of truth, <br>
moving through the waves that found<br> 
us, <br>
as we cross gently<br>
Towards the open horizon<br> 
Towards the setting Sun<br>
Towards an undefined place<br>
at the right pace<br>

A pace that feels right.<br> 

We're moving slowly <br>
Deliberately<br>
Taking time to breathe<br>
and sing with courage<br>
In tune with the world <br>
we're a part of.<br>

As fast as the wind permits.<br> 
As fast as our dreams.<br>

We grow <br>

We grow and let go and move on<br>
To finally feel at ease <br>
At home.<br>

And who knows...<br>
Maybe one day I'll find you on a journey towards a distant shore? <br>
Being mesmerised<br>
for a few moments more<br>
together<br>
in awe<br>
with the everpresent water<br>
carrying us away<br>
Wherever we would like to go<br>
provided that the Ocean will be kind<br> 
to our Souls<br>
and our fragile bodies<br>

There is no need to fear this magnificent old being.<br>
Fear kills<br>
by clouding hearts<br>
with dread<br>

Instead, <br>
Let's Be Courage, Love and Respect,<br>
being grateful for every breath<br>
and every mile behind us<br>
and in front of us<br>
And again<br>
Let's sing together with the roaring wind <br>
and dance on every passing wave<br>
celebrating being alive <br>
and awake<br>
right now<br>
right Here <br>

we are present<br>
pure and vulnerable,<br>
Facing our true essence:<br>

**Being weak, <br>
and strong enough to admit it.** <br>

adrift with purpose<br>
and committed<br>
to the heartbeat of the Earth<br>
dreaming awake<br>
tuned and reflected <br>
in patterns<br>
of the waves<br>

illuminated<br>

and <br>

connected<br>

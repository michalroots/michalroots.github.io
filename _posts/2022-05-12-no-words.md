He sits at the crossroads waiting for her<br>
and she appears waving<br>
from behind the curve<br>

they sit still together feeling what needs to be said<br>
and yet <br>

no words come out<br>

so they wait<br>

listening to the sound of birds <br>
and wind and time passing by<br>
there is clearly something in the air<br>
and yet <br>

no words are coming out<br>

a tear slides down her cheek<br>
merging with a soft smile<br>
there's closeness embedded so deep<br>
and yet<br>

there are no words coming out<br>

he closes his eyes for a moment<br>
they know each other so well<br>
and when he looks up she is gone<br> 

and no words need to be said.<br>

*No Words came out after a powerful meeting without words.*

[Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target="_blank"} is a regenerative co-living in Portugal, 1.5 hour South of Lisbon with DNA of reforestation, web3 and creativity.

I first visited in November 2021, returned for longer in March 2022, fell in love and got involved in the core team resulting in stewarding TDF June-September 2022. Since then I've been moving between different roles, orbiting both closer and further from the project. I am in it for the long game.

**The objective of this resource is three-fold:**

1. **Reflect on my personal experience of TDF with the intention of identifying ingredients, ideas and metrics important for regenerative projects.**
2. **Provide an insightful resource for builders of the regenerative ecosystem and community designers.**
3. **Refine my thinking about community building, with a particular focus on people and culture.**

ðŸš¨ Please note that this resource should not be considered as the "whole picture", nor does it reflect the official statement of TDF. It's just me, MichaÅ‚, wrapping my thoughts about my experience of the project, because I see tremendous value in documenting the good, the bad and the ugly. ðŸš¨

I anticipate that this resource will evolve overtime, ideally with each TDF visit. I'll be working this out as I go. And who knows, maybe one day we can have a Sheepy Grimoire telling the epic tale of TDF?

One last note - I work with positive impact projects. If you wish to work together, [my website](https://michalkorzonek.com) has all the info.


## March 2025

This time I'm visiting TDF in the exhale moment. It is right after an event and we have around 25 people on the ground. There's a parallel small event with around 10 people happening on the big land. The founder and space host are away for a few days. It is sunny after a long period of rain - you can feel the general happiness and chill vibe in the air. The build is happening - workers are building the floor in the building that used to be glamping accommodation.

I'm visiting as a guest, using $Carrots to pay for accommodation + â‚¬12/day for the meal plan & utilities.

### Booking System

I'll start here because to come to TDF I had to make a web3-powered booking. I earned my fair share of tokens so it's time to use them (1 $TDF = 1 night of stay, renewing yearly) and $Carrots (same idea, but one time use).

It didn't work. First, my 3 $TDF tokens got staked (I can't use them for a year), â‚¬ weren't charged, and the booking didn't go through. I didn't want to risk staking more tokens for nothing, so I tried again using $Carrots. The system charged me â‚¬12 more than expected, and somehow I *received* 4 $Carrots (rather than spending them), and the booking still didn't go through.

I reached out to our web3 support channel LINK and the problems were resolved within a couple of hours, although the booking on my profile still shows as "unpaid" and the tokens will remain staked (I should be compensated with $Carrots, let's see).

That's a pretty frustrating experience, and it's not the first time that it happens. Breath in, breath out, move on.

### Pick up

There's nothing quite like a friend picking you up, and seeing Dylan and Bart in TDF Van waiting for me on the train station immediately makes me smile. The ~20-minute ride is not to be underestimated - it creates a very welcoming feeling and provides an opportunity for a softer landing into TDF. You get to catch up with your friends, or get to know a new person. If that's your first time then you immediately have a friend, who can then connect you to another person you need to meet (usually someone who is in charge of managing accommodation).

I absolutely love that we are doing pick ups. Please, let's not stop this!

### Arriving & Onboarding

Arriving to TDF feels like stepping into another world, and I love the feeling.

I get taken to my glamping tent which gives the first opportunity to see what's up on the land. Unfortunately I get no onboarding beyond that. As a long-time member I can easily find my way around, but it'd be nice to get a quick download of the current protocols and rituals. And if that's a first-time visit then it's absolutely vital.

**I'm a huge believer in a high-quality onboarding. It just makes everyone's experience so much better.** I hope that I got forgotten due to the issues with my booking.

### On-site comms

To communicate on the ground I get added to a telegram group spanning across an entire season â€“ Spring 2025. It replaced TDF Today whatsapp group, which was a continuous group where you get added when you arrive and get kicked out a few days after you leave.

Since the focus is only on the on-the-ground comms (eg. *Dinner ready!*, *Someone seen my banjo?*, *Boar invasion in progress!*) I really don't need to be a part of it after I depart. 

The seasonal group brings more connectivity between visitors within a season, and I can archive it when I leave, but it just feels like a less elegant solution and I have a preference for the previous system. Nothing to Baaaah about though. Organising hundreds of comms groups is not an easy task and if it makes it easier to manage TDF then you have my full support.

### Build is happening!

First things that grab my eye are two big white containers. They're a bit too clean to give a proper burn feeling, but one thing is clear - things are being built at TDF! The long awaited moment is finally here. I walk around the land and buildings and enjoy the changes.

We seem to have two builds happening in parallel - one done by professionals and one by our community.

The professionals obviously know what they are doing, and what makes me happy is to notice the quality of our build. The new showers and toilets look class! It seems like we're managing to build proper things that will last, rather than freestyle our way around temporary things. I still remember the shitshow around building the Shit Tower... Proper plan + execution means less wasted energy and resources, and perhaps more importantly, less frustration within the community.

Let's keep up with this trend! ðŸš€

### Land tour

This always was and still is a strong part. You might be frustrated by some things in the project, but then you head to the land, look at the growing reforestation area, witness the garden, climb a treehouse and everything is okay again.

Spring is here, everything looks green and lush, and there's soo much water in the land after the recent period of rainfall.

### The Pond

We now have a pond! Ahhh, it's so nice to hop into the cold water during the hot afternoon. It's a total game changer.

### Accommodation

More dorms! It seems that we have more volunteers on the ground and we need to house them. There's more vans too. And there's the first semi-permanent structure - a yurt of the core team. It's nice to see.

### Food

Food is one of the strongest points of TDF. I don't know another project that comes even close to the deliciousness and variety of food we get to eat.

The secret is the diverse and well-stocked pantry and the collaborative cooking board - everyone commits to prepping 1-2 meals per week and you're free to use any ingredient you want. The result is a big diversity of meals and somehow everyone is motivated to make very tasty food. And I love that everything is vegetarian.

As a dessert wizard I have a reputation to uphold, and by a perfect synchronicity I ended up pairing with the resident pastry master.

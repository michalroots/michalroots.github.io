I'm a big fan of publishing open-source documentation.

- Documentation helps me reflect on the process and make sense of what is happening
- Documentation invites meaningful feedback and connections
- Documentation inspires (or has potential to do so) other people to learn by doing

But perhaps the most important thing for me, is that creating *documentation* completely removes the writing block and tames my inner perfectionist. I just write about what is happening - raw and unpolished, rather than infinitely perfecting and never actually publishing.

I've been doing this for quite a while now, and it seems that I have become relatively decent at the craft.

## Regenerative Documentation Index

Here's the list of some of my favourite documentation projects.

It all started as a note in Obsidian which really wanted to be published. Since [my Obsidian vault is linked directly with this website](obsidian-to-github), it's actually frictionless to make this note publicly available. I guess I just can't stop documenting ðŸ˜‚.

I'll keep updating this post whenever I feel like. Feel free to **share your fav documentation projects with me**, either via email or in this twitter thread.

### 100 Rabbits
> *"We research and test low-tech solutions and document our findings with the hope of building a more resilient future."*

- [100 Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html)

This documentation absolutely blew my mind and is my all time favourite project.

### Microsolidarity

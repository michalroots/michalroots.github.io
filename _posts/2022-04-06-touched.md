I'm falling asleep tonight <br>
having touched you <br>
having held you <br>
connected. <br>

The doorway opened <br>
shaping a path towards your Soul <br>
and in a brief moment of courage <br>
I took a leap to move closer. <br>

You met me halfway <br>
our eyes met <br>
our souls met <br>
and so did our bodies <br>

I felt shivers that moment <br>
the kind that shake me <br>
and make me feel <br>
alive <br>

My body is still humming quietly <br>
as I sink into myself at night <br>
being present and being a part <br>
of you. <br>

I'm falling asleep tonight
having touched you
having held you
connected.

The doorway opened
shaping a path towards your Soul
and in a brief moment of courage
I took a leap to move closer.

You met me halfway
our eyes met
our souls met
and so did our bodies

I felt shivers that moment
the kind that shake me
and make me feel
alive

My body is still humming quietly
as I sink into myself at night
being present and being a part
of you.

Context:

In a very spontaneous, last-minute decision, I decided to go to Waking Life festival. On top of the usual festival gear, I took with me a blank journal, a set of colourful pens, and a lot of empty cards.

This is a story of how I spend the few days walking around and creating moments of deep connection through the combination of playful pattern breaking, and holding space for creative expression.

The result of my journey, a notebook called *"The Cocreated Story of Awaking Life"* is a co-created artefact created through beautiful interactions with people met along the festival.

Let's browse through.

COVER

Every story needs to begin somewhere.

I arrived at Sunset and right after pitching my tent, I went to explore the festival. My intuition separated me from my friends almost immediately, and led me to crawl through a tunnel into the beautiful cuddly dome called Cosmic Tickle.

It's always a very special moment for me to introduce a creative experiment. A performer part in me is super excited to step on stage and shine, but there's also Fear. I love Fear. It's one of the most challenging emotions, and yet, whenever I dare to look it in the eye and face it - magick happens.

The first encounter resulted in creating a magic card that allowed me to travel through the festival in the most wonderful way:

A beautiful dedication to our book:

And a page exploring an important question:

There is something powerful that happens when people create. There's a very tangible shift of energy in the room when we collectively move from consuming to creating. Patterns break, new ideas emerge, and conversations go way deeper.

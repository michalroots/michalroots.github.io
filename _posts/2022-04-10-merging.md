Context: *Merging* is participatory experience exploring the power of physical touch, co-created with [Austeja Liupševičiūtė](https://austejaliu.com){:target="_blank"}.

My Role: concept, space-holding, facilitation

Magic: combining cacao and guided touch into a simple yet powerful experience.

> -- Marilou

> "I could feel so much love and tenderness and openness in the room... It was so beautiful. It's very precious to be a part of it."
> -- Silvia

> "I don't know if my heart was as big before as I feel it now. I feel really connected to you... You are in me like little bubbles."
> -- Hanna

Context: *Magic Spells* was the first full-on party design I created, bringing local artists to transform a flat being into an interactive playground.

Magic: Transforming a regular party, with all the usual patterns (drinking / socialising) into a magical exploration by engaging people in interactions with the space.

My Role: Concept, installation exploring facebook addiction, sound installation in the bathroom, video projection

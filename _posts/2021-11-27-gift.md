## Dear Santa,

I am in a privilledged position of my monthly expenses being more or less covered by my online business, at least for now. After four years of entrepreneurial learning curve I finally managed to pay myself â‚¬600 for a few months in a row, which feels encouraging. It wasn't always like that.

In the same time, it doesn't really leave much space for investing in what my heart calls me to invest in: regenerating the land and taking part in experiences helping me to grow in that direction.

That's why I'm writing this letter to ask you for a Gift.

As a minimalist on a constant journey to have less items and more space, I learned that offering a gift is a beautiful but challenging art. For example, for a long time my family kept giving me stuff, which while being given from the heart and therefore appreciated, was, generally speaking, useless for me and only created unnecessary clutter.

What I learned through this process is:

a) experiences generally make much better gifts for me.

b) it is my responsability to communicate clearly which gifts are the most aligned with what my heart points me towards right now, instead of expecting another person to know that intuitively.

This letter is an externalisation of these two lessons in a form of a public wishlist, supported by a firm belief that there is plenty of abundance of different sorts all around, and that within the Gift Economy (which we are indeed all a part of) the gifts gravitate towards the place where they are needed most.

I'm not saying that the items on my list are *universally speaking* the biggest voids in the universe waiting to be filled. **I already have all that I need.** However, it is possible that you are in a position to fill these voids for me, and thus make a real positive impact in my life, and, through ripple effect, the lives of others.

Whether that's the case or not, I'm grateful for your presence, and I wish you wonderful Winter Holidays, whichever and whenever you choose to celebrate.

With Love and Gratitude,<br>
MichaÅ‚.

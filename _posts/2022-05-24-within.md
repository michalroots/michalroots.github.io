The phone life<br>
is definitely not<br>
the life I want to live<br>

Okay, so what is<br>
the life I do want to live,<br>
and, in case it is not<br>
precisely the life I am living,<br>
then why am I not living<br>
the life I want?<br>

The truth is<br>
that I can<br>
and the only thing<br>
stopping me is myself<br>
which is actually a scary thought<br>
because why would I<br>
sabotage myself<br>
and sacrifice my own wellbeing<br>
for other stuff,<br>
from which at least a chunk<br>
is crap.<br>

It is indeed a mystery<br>
and to relieve myself from misery<br>
I am pausing myself right now<br>
to ask:<br>

What is the life I want to live?<br>

And, in case it is not<br>
precisely the life I am living then<br> 
why is that?<br>

I can change all on a whim<br>
all it takes is to face the storm<br> 
within.

*"Within" came out as I was waiting in a sailors bar, pondering on two important questions: 1) why am I not sailing as a lifestyle, and 2) why sailors who enter the bar are not wearing big flamboyant hats.*

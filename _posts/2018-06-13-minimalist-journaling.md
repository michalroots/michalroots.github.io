Context: 

*Minimalist Journaling System* (which I eventually rebranded as *Infinity Squares*) is a journaling practice I developed to build consistency with habits that matter.

Over 1400+ days of consistent use, I discovered that squares are much more than just a tool for habits. Instead they are an **intuitive journaling operating system, a visual representation of how your life unfolds, and a daily ritual of grounding and re-alignment.**

Infinity Squares is the core practice in my life, and has impacted hundreds of people who decided to implement this method into their journals.

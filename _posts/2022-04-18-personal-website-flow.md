My personal website is pretty much targeted for me.

The fact that it's published online, adds pressure on what I publish, but more importantly helps me overcome perfectionistic tendencies. It took me 3 months to write [this article]. It was worth it, but I could have done it in 2 weeks. I just kept getting stuck in perfecting, even if deep down I knew that it will never be perfect anyway, and that's totally fine, too.

Well... Mistakes were made, and learnt from (hopefully). And now I have my website.

Here's how it works:

I publish unfinished stuff, but I publish it consistently. And since [everything is written and managed directly inside my Obsidian vault], which is the central point of my digital [focus], I can update anything I publish effortlessly, at any time, on my laptop or phone. I press Alt+Tab, write a letter "g" and press enter. Then click "commit to main" and finalise the process by clicking "push origin". Robots do their work, and the website is updated.

It takes approximately me 2 seconds.

I keep seeing all my files on the left. Folder structure includes 3 web projects (my personal website, [journalsmarter] and [microsolidarity in pico]), each with /assets folder with images. I can manipulate all files, restructure websites, move files from one project to another, link in between etc, and then in 2 seconds it's published.

This is the first part of strategy, which is complimented by the fact that not many people read my personal website (or at least I assume so, and I have no data to check, because the site has no tracking of any sort, which is a deliberate decision because tracking on the internet is creepy. But I digress). Not many readers = not much pressure, in fact it's probably just me and you right now who have ever visited this page.

No resistance to publish + no pressure to publish is a combo that really does it for me.

For context, I was just editing a [poem] which I wrote during a sailing trip which begun the transition into the chapter of my life that has just concluded right now as I write these words right now (okay, not exactly, but the actual day of the new beginning is only a couple of days off, which makes me consider it as quite precisely timed in the vastness of Time and Space).

I was editing the poem when an idea bounced into my mind to start writing a meta article about my writing workflow, because it feels like a useful gift I could offer to someone who'd like to make writing a self-inflicted addiction. **I struggled to build a digital writing habit, so I turned it into addiction.** I can feel my [certified habit coach part] giving me a shoulder pat as I type these words, btw.

I clicked Ctrl+N, abandoned the poem for a while (we'll come back to it later, because it's a special one), and begun writing a new note with a raw title How I Use My Personal Website.

I furiously typed the next 598 words. Breath. 600.

Then took this screenshot:

(There will be a few more in this article - I've been taking them occasionally since I want to show how I do it, instead of just telling the story.)

If I'd like to publish it right now, I'd rename the name of the note by clicking on it - so it can be formatted for publishing. I'd call it:

```
2022-04-18-personal-website-flow
```

Which would make me consider the title of this article. In the past I'd obsess about finding a perfect title, but now I'd just leave it as it is, noticing my recovering perfectionist part closing its eyes with horror! ðŸ™ˆ). 

The part would get absolutely terrified, as I'd would follow the note with this article being moved into the folder containing my published website.
```
/web/heymichal.github.io/_posts
```

At this point I actually went through the steps I just outlined, which lead to having a third look at the title of this article which resulted in a decision to call it:

Personal Website Flow - How I Use This Website

Not perfect, but good enough for now and safe enough to try.

I've inserted the front matter, which forced me to give a description and add relevant tags.

And just like that this note is ready to publish.

It's live.




(to get it ready for a spoken word collaboration with [JoÃ£o Moreira] - one of the two Portuguese man whom I feel deeply in Love with many years back in Albania, and on my return to Edinburgh which was my home at the time, I immediately booked my tickets to Portugal to fly there 2 months later. It turned out that I'd meet a Lover I would spend 8 years together with and eventually also move to Portugal.

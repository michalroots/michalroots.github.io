My personal website is pretty much targeted for me.

The fact that it's published online, adds pressure on what I publish, but more importantly helps me overcome perfectionistic tendencies. It took me 3 months to write [this article]. It was worth it, but I could have done it in 2 weeks. I just kept getting stuck in perfecting, even if deep down I knew that it will never be perfect anyway, and that's totally fine, too.

Well... Mistakes were made, and learnt from (hopefully). And now I have my website.

Here's how it works:

I publish unfinished stuff, but I publish it consistently. And since [everything is written and managed directly inside my Obsidian vault], which is the central point of my digital [focus], I can update anything I publish effortlessly, at any time, on my laptop or phone. I press Alt+Tab, write a letter "g" and press enter. Then click "commit to main" and finalise the process by clicking "push origin". Robots do their work, and the website is updated.

It takes me approximately 2 seconds.

I keep seeing all my files on the left. Folder structure includes 3 web projects (my personal website, [journalsmarter] and [microsolidarity in pico]), each with /assets folder with images. I can manipulate all files, restructure websites, move files from one project to another, link in between etc, and then in 2 seconds it's published.

This is the first part of my strategy, which is complimented by the fact that not many people read my personal website (or at least I assume so, and I have no data to check, because the site has no tracking of any sort, which is a deliberate decision because tracking on the internet is creepy. But I digress). Not many readers = not much pressure, in fact it's probably just me and you right now who have ever visited this page.

No resistance to publish + no pressure to publish is a combo that really does it for me.

For context, I was just editing a [poem] which I wrote during a sailing trip which begun the transition into the chapter of my life that has just concluded as I write these words right now (okay, not exactly, but the actual day of the new beginning is only a couple of days off, which makes me consider it as quite precisely timed in the vastness of Time and Space).

As I was editing the poem, an idea bounced into my mind: start writing a meta article about my writing workflow, because it feels like a useful gift I could offer to someone who'd like to make writing a self-inflicted addiction. **I struggled to build a digital writing habit, so I turned it into addiction.** I can feel my [certified habit coach part] giving me a shoulder pat as I type these words, btw.

I clicked Ctrl+N, abandoned the poem for a while (we'll come back to it later, because it's a special one), and begun writing a new note with a raw title How I Use My Personal Website.

I furiously typed the next 598 words. Breath. 600.

Then took this screenshot:

(There will be a few more in this article - I've been taking them occasionally since I want to show how I do it, instead of just telling the story.)

If I'd like to publish it right now, I'd rename the name of the note by clicking on it - so it can be formatted for publishing. I'd call it:

```
2022-04-18-personal-website-flow
```

Which would make me consider the title of this article. In the past I'd obsess about finding a perfect title, but now I'd just leave it as it is, noticing my recovering perfectionist part closing its eyes with horror! üôà). 

The part would get absolutely terrified, as it would begin following the note with this article being moved into the folder containing my published website.
```
/web/heymichal.github.io/_posts
```

At this point I actually went through the steps I just outlined, which brought the third look at the title of this article which resulted in a decision to call it:
```
Personal Website Flow - How I Use This Website
```

Not perfect, but good enough for now and safe enough to try.

I've copy pasted the front matter (I could have inserted it from template to make it faster), which forced me to add a description and relevant tags.

And just like that this note is ready to publish.

It's imperfect as fuck. I mean there is a paragraph typed below that I wrote before, but decided not to include, but felt bad to deleted because I felt it's a good paragraph to come back to. There are no screenshots included, the links are all missing, but here's the most important thing:

I just published a 911 words article in 20 minutes or so, I'm not even sure.

I might tweet it, just for the laughs. I feel like it's something that [Rob] would appreciate.

As I get ready to copy the link to make a tweet I read the published article, to catch some basic spelling mistakes and small shit like that. I won't bother with deep proof reading, adding images or completing the article for now.

Proofreading is now complete, which means I can shift to GitHub Desktop and commit.

That all it takes.

Funny enough, I decide not to take this final step right now, because I notice the paragraph written below again, and I want to make it an integral part of this article, rather than leaving a random paragraph.

Back to the poem then, so the paragraph below can make some sense at least...

I was editing it so I can get it ready for a spoken word collaboration with [Jo√£o Moreira] - one of the two Portuguese man whom I connected with deeply many years back in Albania, and on my return to Edinburgh which was my home at the time, I immediately booked my tickets to Portugal to fly there 2 months later. It turned out that I'd find a Lover I would spend 8 years together with, and eventually move to Portugal, where I'm living now (although it's not the continental part of Portugal).

Okay, tangent finished. The poem is still awaiting editing, which is actually perfect.

I can finally publish this article you are reading right now, send the link to Rob, and then come back to what I was doing before a sudden breeze of air would bring me here.

I used to be a turtle.

Now I am a bird.

ps. Next time we meet in person, feel free to ask me to greet you with the wonderfully strange bird call from the island located not too far from the Atlantis.

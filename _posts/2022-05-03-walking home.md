I'm walking back into myself<br>
after taking a moment to look<br>
far far far far far away<br>

seeing the stars brightening<br> 
me with their light<br>

noticing parts<br>
oh so many parts<br>

they are all here with me<br>
waiting to have their turn at speaking<br>

and frankly, it's quite awkward<br>
to hear all of them at once<br>

they seem quite contradictory<br>
some of them have a very good sense of humour<br>
but others are just fucking angry all the time<br>
and you can't have much of a conversation<br>
or at least not an intelligible one<br>

But here I am sitting with all of them<br>
and it's fine<br>

it's okay<br>

I'm alright<br>

I'm brightened by light<br>
and it feels good to be standing here<br> 
watching the ocean fade into the night <br>
under the stars<br>

they are so bright the stars<br>

*Walking Home is inspired by a moment with a friend, when we realised that in spite of what numerous demagogic voices of reason inside each of us claim sometimes: it is actually fine.*

(I couldn't help myself... I had to begin with quoting *[Cabin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua1FAlHt_Ys){:target="_blank"}* by Ylvis).

**I lived in many homes and this one was my favourite - a tiny wooden cabin in the middle of a beautiful forest, with a window into the Ocean.**

I was given an opportunity to live here and customise the insides to fit my lifestyle. Wood is a perfect canvas. Over a few months the Cabin transformed into a powerful creativity boosting power place, and a blueprint for my future Home.

## Reflections

A wise man once said that it takes three houses to build a perfect one. While I haven't built the cabin myself (I only helped a bit with finishing and did some interior improvements), it gives me a great starting point for creating my first home, whenever the time for it comes.

A few improvements I'd consider doing with the cabin design:

- **Sand and varnish all the wood inside** - without it there's plenty of wood dust, which can't be too healthy to breathe.
- **Invest in good doors** - the doors to the cabin are not very thick and in very heavy rainfall the water comes through.
- **Opening windows at the top** - this would add an easy way to keep the air flowing in times when opening the front doors is not a viable option.
- **Add a wood burning stove** - this is a bit tricky, since it's a tiny wooden house, but there must be a way to have a tiny wooden stove inside to heat the place up in winter without relying on electricity.
- **Consider adding insulation** - I'm not 100% sure about this because it would take some precious space, but it might be worthwhile especially on cold days.
- **Soundproofing the roof** - when it rains it can get very loud inside. Insulation would do the trick.
- **Instal a basic water system outside** - I have a bucket with the water collected from the roof, which works, but adding a tiny bit of sophistication would be great.
- **Keep the food out** - it's not the cabin's fault per se (I just don't have a good food storage around), but I'd much rather not keep my eating station inside. 
- **Add a trap door / hidden back door** - for fun, and to have a second exit.
- **Cat flap** for Kiki to move freely in and out üêà.

## Deep Work Retreat
I'm on a quest to raise funds for a community land in Pico, with a forest, a community space and a few cabins serving as a deep work / creative / personal regeneration retreat centre.

If you'd like to help to make this dream a reality, consider supporting my work via [Patreon](https://patreon.com/michalkorzonek){:target="_blank"} and/or reach out directly if you'd like to make a bigger investment‚ú®.

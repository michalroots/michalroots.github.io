**Gratitude Tokens is a collaborative game designed to catalyse expressing gratitude within a community.**

## Overview
Gratitude is a state of the highest vibration. Gratitude Tokens play with the cryptocurrency mechanics, by creating a physical token incentivising expressing gratitude within a community in a playful way.

Note: by now I am not really using the Gratitude Ledger as it felt to complicated in practice. It's a beautiful piece of the game though, so I'll keep the instructions in case you want to incorporate it or build upon it.

☀️ This game was prototyped with [Bart Hoorweg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bart-hoorweg){:target="_blank"} at the [Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target="_blank"}.

🃏 Gratitude token has now been carrrdified.

🐥 [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1507047355291471890?s=21){:target="_blank"} for the game.

## Prep
- Prepare tokens by cutting a thick branch into small coins. Make sure there's at least one per person, plus a few additional tokens. You can also use carrrds of course.
- Prepare a few markers and a pen.
- (optional) Grab a notebook (or a few pieces of paper) and create a Gratitude Token Ledger. Draw the Gratitude Token symbol on the cover page, then write tokenomics instructions on the first available page. You can then "mint" the first token and record the first entry in the ledger (see below).
- Optional but fun to have: a piece of paper stating: HODL ≠ GWYC

## Gratitude Token Ledger

Below are the instructions (v1) to include in the Ledger. Feel free to modify them to fit your context. You'll find a few ideas at the end.

### Tokenomics
1. A Gratitude Token is a physical object serving as a catalyst to express gratitude.
2. Give your Gratitude Token(s) to people you feel grateful for.
3. Do not HODL your tokens! Instead Give Whenever You Can – GWYC (pronounce: QUICK)
4. If you realise that you are HODLing Gratitude Token(s), take a moment to be grateful for all the gifts in your life and give your token(s) away to someone that deserves it.
5. If you suspect someone is HODLing Gratitude Tokens, give them a Gratitude Token to model giving behaviour.
6. Whenever you run out of tokens, you can mint new Gratitude Tokens at any time at your local minting station. To mint, prepare a wooden piece, draw the Gratitude Token Symbol, and add a personal mark. Next, state your Proof of Work by completing an entry in the Gratitude Token Ledger by drawing *your personal mark* and answer in writing *why are you minting this token.*

## Introducing Gratitude Tokens 
Here's a suggested format. Tweak as necessary to fit your context.

1. *Gratitude Modeling Check-in*: Pass a Gratitude Token (eg. the first one you minted during the prep) as a talking stick. When it's your turn to speak, share with the next person what are you grateful for to them. The aim of this round is to bring everyone to the gratitude vibration, as well as model using the token.
2. *Gratitude Token Info*: Share about the importance of gratitude and explain why you want to introduce this game in your community. If you have played this game before you can also share a personal story.
3. *Tokenomics*: Read out the tokenomics instructions and check for clarity. If you have a "HODL ≠ GWYC" sign, then show it while explaining rule 3 - it helps people get the joke.
4. *Minting*: Invite everyone to mint a token and record an entry into the ledger. Note that recording in the ledger might take a while.
5. *Next Steps*: Invite the group to pass the gratitude tokens. Share the collective challenge of the game: make every token pass through as many hands as possible.
6. *Closing*: Close the session with a check-out of your choice.

## Notes
- Tokens don't need to stay within a community. Make them travel ⛵️and remember to *GWYC*.
- If you receive a gratitude token out of nowhere and/or decide to introduce this game in your community, I'd love to connect with you.
- Idea to explore: *Gratitude Token Burn Ceremony*
- Idea to explore: *Programmable Tokens* - use the backside of the token to add extra instructions to the token

## Tokenomics Proposals
Have a new proposal? Submit it via our telegram group.

- When illegal tender (not registered in the ledger) is found, the present members of the gratitude economy will burn the token in an Abundance Ceremony where we express our gratitude for the land, space, community, and all of the surrounding abundance. *{source: TDF}*
- New arrivals are welcomed with a gratitude token and encouraged to mint their own when the first grateful moment arises. *{source: TDF}*
- When a token has gone full circle (every community member has had it at some point), it can be offered back to nature in an Abundance Ceremony (burning the token). *{source: TDF}*
- Whenever you find a TOOP (Token Out Of Place) take a moment to reflect what are you grateful for and claim it as yours. Don't HODL! *{source: Pico}*

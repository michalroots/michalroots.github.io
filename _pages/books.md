WTF is semi-nomadism? A group of 14 semi-nomads co-created this book during a month-long mastermind. With 3 hours of card play per day and a total of 867 cards we have distiled hands-on experiences of semi-nomadic lifestyles into a 190 page illustrated book.  
  
Embark with us on an exploratory dance to uncover what it means to be a semi-nomad. We’ll journey through varied landscapes, dive deep into meaningful insights, and engage in practical how-to’s.

The 170 page illustrated book, weaves together **lineages of wisdom and practical experience from a worldwide tribe of regenerative village builders** - serving as an emergent base of knowledge, as well as actionable blueprint.

The book was co-created by a **multidisciplinary team of 28 regenerative pioneers**, using a unique **playful co-creation methodology** developed by Treehouse DAO facilitators. The unedited version of **the book was completed within an 11-day mastermind**.

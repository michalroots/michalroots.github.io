title: I Create Books For Positive Impact Organisations

summary:

Why books?

Books are far from dead. They are **tangible artefacts distilling the vibe, knowledge, and work of your organisation** into a physical item sending ripples into the world.

The physical nature of books ensures creative constraints helping you **focus on the most important information to communicate**. There's nothing stopping you from turning it into an infinitely expanding digital ecosystem afterwards. Still - a book is a book. It just feels different than a website, doesn't it?

This is not *just* about the book, though...

## The Process

There is a very tangible magic in the air that emerges when people **gather to create something together** in the same physical space. We are after that magic, topped up with a very special ingredient:

**Serious Fun**.

Play is at the core of the creative process I offer. **Play opens up limitless creativity, removes performance anxiety, and creates the unique shared experience** that will transform your team into a humming super-organism. The book that will emerge from that state will reflect that.

Shall we make yours?

The 174 pages illustrated book, weaves together lineages of wisdom and practical experience from a worldwide tribe of regenerative village builders - serving as an emergent base of knowledge, as well as actionable blueprint, encouraging the transition towards a regenerative way of living.
  
**The book was co-created by a multidisciplinary team of 28 regenerative pioneers during an 11-day mastermind**, which I had the pleasure of facilitating.

ADD COVER IMAGE

**Why books?**

Books are far from dead. They are **tangible artefacts distilling the vibe, knowledge, and work of your organisation** into a physical item sending ripples into the world.

The physical nature of books ensures creative constraints helping you **focus on the most important information to communicate**. There's nothing stopping you from turning it into an infinitely expanding digital ecosystem afterwards. Still - a book is a book. It just feels different than a website, doesn't it?

This is not *just* about the book, though...

## The Process

ADD GROUP VIBES IMAGE

There is a very tangible magic in the air that emerges when people **gather to create something together** in the same physical space. We are after that magic, topped up with a very special ingredient:

**Serious Fun**.

Play is at the core of the creative process I offer. **Play opens up limitless creativity, removes performance anxiety, and creates the unique shared experience** that will transform your team into a humming super-organism. The book that will emerge from that state will reflect that.

Shall we make yours?

Books:
-  "[How to Build A Regenerative Village](https://treehousedao.earth){:target="_blank"} "

![Cover of the book](/assets/regen-village-cover.jpg)

**This 174 pages illustrated book was co-created by a multidisciplinary team of 28 regenerative pioneers during an 11-day mastermind**, which I had the pleasure of facilitating.

It weaves together lineages of wisdom and practical experience from a worldwide tribe of regenerative village builders - serving as an emergent base of knowledge, as well as actionable blueprint, encouraging the **transition towards a regenerative way of living**.
  
**I've documented the creation process** live in this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1565240255564980225){:target="_blank"}.

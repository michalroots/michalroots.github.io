## Portfolio

### "[How to Build A Regenerative Village](https://treehousedao.earth){:target="_blank"} "

![Cover of the book](/assets/regen-village-cover.jpg)

The 174 pages illustrated book, weaves together lineages of wisdom and practical experience from a worldwide tribe of regenerative village builders - serving as an emergent base of knowledge, as well as actionable blueprint, encouraging the transition towards a regenerative way of living.
  
**The book was co-created by a multidisciplinary team of 28 regenerative pioneers during an 11-day mastermind**, which I had the pleasure of facilitating.

I've documented the creation process live in this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1565240255564980225){:target="_blank"}.

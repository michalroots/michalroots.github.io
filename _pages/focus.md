**I'm available to bring my energy into your project, organisation and community.**

A few keywords that bring spark into my eyes: #regenerative #belonging #meaningfulwork #refi #bioregion #island #village #nonhierarchical #playful #foodforest

Here's how I can be of service:

- [**I create moments that move the energy forward**](/experiences){:target="_blank"} -> gatherings & events with relational rhythms to catalyse continuous co-creation and regeneration
- [**I tell stories documenting beautiful dreams becoming reality**](/documentation){:target="_blank"} -> I write (news)letters, articles and documentation

*Note: My long-term goal is to move towards gift economy, as much as possible. You can accelerate this process via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/michalkorzonek){:target="_blank"}.*

<b>No Fear. Dream Big. Manifest. Shine.</b>

âœ¨

**I create and document regenerative communities.**

I'm implementing [microsolidarity in Pico Island](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc){:target="_blank"}, working towards *Azores Regenerative Network*. This is my #1 priority in 2022.

I also contribute to [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com){:target="_blank"}.

- I'm committed to playing the **long-game of Earth stewardship**
- I am a **natural catalyst / coordinator** with over 15+ years of experience in **facilitation and creating spaces for people**
- I believe in creating and sharing **open-source documentation** in order to **inspire**, **send ripples**, **spread the regenerative culture**.

Other activities that are important to me:

- **creating [journaling games](https://journalsmarter.com){:target="_blank"}** serving as a daily ritual for grounding and re-alignment. 
- **writing heartfelt [letters](letters)**
- walking
- enjoying simple life in a tiny wooden cabin in the middle of a beautiful forest.

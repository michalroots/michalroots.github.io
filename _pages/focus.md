**I create moments and stories.**

<p>üå≥‚õµÔ∏è‚ú®</p>

## Now:

- Publishing **the open-source playbook for regenerative village builders**. Here's the [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1565240255564980225?s=20&t=CrGEdV_kJuVTRUqsIrsVkg){:target="_blank"} documenting the mastermind where the book was created. We're now going through editing and final compilation. Exciting!

*(Note to self: limit amount of focus projects, ideally to ONE. When completed, move to [archive](/archive){:target="_blank"}.*

## I actively contribute to:

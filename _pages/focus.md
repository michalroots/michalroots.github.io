I thrive most when **bringing people together** into a **container for co-creation**, aligned with transitioning towards a **regenerative lifestyle**.

Short version:

**I create moments and stories.**

## Now:

- Facilitating **Regenerative Village Builders Mastermind**, where we're **co-creating an open-source book** for aspiring village builders. Live documentation in this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1562439997416177664){:target="_blank"}

*(Note to self: limit amount of focus projects, ideally to ONE. When completed, move to [archive](/archive){:target="_blank"}.*

## I actively contribute to:

- [**Traditional Dream Factory**](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target="_blank"} - regenerative village in Portugal

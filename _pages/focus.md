**I create moments and stories.**

## Now:

- **Prototyping Pico Cabin Residency** - a community run space for regens and open source creators, designed for deep rest and deep focus. Live documentation in this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1578695706466222080?s=20&t=CrGEdV_kJuVTRUqsIrsVkg){:target="_blank"}, and here's the [Info Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zbz3Ka5x7zVrJwBafn2mdW2oqRrdxNXoIMzwTkZiFIY/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.
- The focus of my residency: **publishing the open-source playbook for regenerative village builders**. Here's the [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1565240255564980225?s=20&t=CrGEdV_kJuVTRUqsIrsVkg){:target="_blank"} documenting the mastermind where the book was created.

*(Note to self: limit amount of focus projects, ideally to ONE. When completed, move to [archive](/archive){:target="_blank"}.*

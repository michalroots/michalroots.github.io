# Focus
**Community Weaving + Creating Experiences + Telling Stories of Dreams Becoming Reality**

✨

I co-create three communities:

- Community Weaving and Catalysing by practicing [microsolidarity in Pico Island](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc){:target="_blank"} (Azores).
- Community Weaving and Connection in [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com){:target="_blank"} Europe + Creating Enspiral Newsletter
- Community Weaving, Legal & Governance, Stewarding Team for summer 2022 in [Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target="_blank"}, the first land-based DAO in Europe.

🌳

I'm available to work with projects, organisations and communities, focused on co-creating a beautiful world where all beings can thrive 

(A few keywords: #regenerative #belonging #meaningfulwork #refi #teal #bioregion #village #nonhierarchical #dao )

Here are two ways I can help:

- **I create [experiences](/experiences) where magic happens** -> I create gatherings, spaces and experiences, building long-lasting community weaving rhythms
- **I tell [stories](/storytelling-documentation) of beautiful dreams becoming reality** -> I create (news)letters & documentation

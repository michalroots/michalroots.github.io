<b>No Fear. Dream Big. Manifest. Shine.</b>

✨

**I create experiences, gatherings and games for regenerative communities.**

**I’m implementing [microsolidarity in Pico Island](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc){:target=„_blank”}**, working towards *Azores Regenerative Network*. 

**I contribute to [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com){:target=„_blank”}** in working groups *Europe Connection* and *Comms*. 

**I’m a member of [Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target=„_blank”}** involved in the *Community Circle*.

**I offer coaching, consulting, and catalysing sessions for community weavers**. I can help with moving the energy, deepening the sense of belonging within your community, implementing microsolidarity, and/or creating amazing documentation.

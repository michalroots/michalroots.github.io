<b>No Fear. Dream Big. Manifest. Shine.</b>

âœ¨

**I create and document regenerative communities.**

**I'm implementing [microsolidarity in Pico Island](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc){:target="_blank"}**, working towards *Azores Regenerative Network*. This is my #1 priority in 2022.

My work involves catalysing the community, coordinating projects, creating spaces for meaningful connection, and documenting the process.

**I also contribute to [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com){:target="_blank"}** in working groups *Europe Connection* and *Comms*.

Other activities that are important to me:

- creating [journaling games](https://journalsmarter.com){:target="_blank"} serving as a daily ritual for grounding and re-alignment. 
- writing heartfelt [letters](letters)
- walking
- enjoying simple life in a tiny wooden cabin in the middle of a beautiful forest.

summary: What I am focusing on at the moment (aka - now page).
---

I playfully (and skilfully) juggle multiple ideas and projects.

The most effective way to see **what I'm up to right now** is to **check out my latest [Moonly Review](https://michalkorzonek.substack.com){:target="_blank"}**, published every ðŸŒ‘ and ðŸŒ•.

## I direct my energy into:

- [**Enspiral**](https://enspiral.com){:target="_blank"} - network helping people do more meaningful work
- [**Traditional Dream Factory**](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target="_blank"} - regenerative village in Portugal
- [**Microsolidarity in Pico**](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc){:target="_blank"} - decentralised village on a small island
- [**Treehouse DAO**](https://treehousedao.earth){:target="_blank"} - web3 publishing organisation focused on regenerating the planet

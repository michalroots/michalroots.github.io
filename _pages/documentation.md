summary: Sending ripples by learning in public.

I can't help creating open source documentation and some people claim I'm good at it.

## Why bother?

-   Documentation helps me **reflect on the process**
-   Documentation invites **meaningful conversations**
-   Documentation **inspires other people to learn by doing**

Win-Win-Win.

**It's all about sending ripples into the world** - by showing the nitty gritty process of making stuff that matters.

**I operate in the gift economy**. It would mean a lot to me if you would consider supporting my work financially - allowing me to dedicate more energy to sharing delightful documentation catalysing the transition towards a regenerative way of living on a personal and planetary level.

> ‚ÄúOne of my favourite things about the Sunday Insights is that they give a window into your world. I love it that not only are you deep thinkers committed to the things that matter most in life, but that you are also committed to being guides on the journey. So grateful to be in satsanga.‚Äù <br> -- Cathy Hutchison

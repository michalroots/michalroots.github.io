The 170 page illustrated book, weaves together **lineages of wisdom and practical experience from a worldwide tribe of regenerative village builders** - serving as an emergent base of knowledge, as well as actionable blueprint.

The book was co-created by a **multidisciplinary team of 28 regenerative pioneers**, using a unique **playful co-creation methodology** developed by Treehouse DAO facilitators. The unedited version of **the book was completed within an 11-day mastermind**.

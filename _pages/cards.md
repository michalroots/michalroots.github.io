## Cardify Anything

Cards are the world's most playful medium, and state of play = state of flow.

Here's how cards can boost engagement with your project:

- **Playful activation and embodied learning of your framework, course, training, or other IP etc**.

Case study: **[Microsolidarity Card Deck](https://microsolidarity.cc/cards){:target="_blank"}** – 47 playable cards guiding you through missions designed to weave social fabric.

- **Create high quality artefacts, such as books, handbooks, guides, etc. in record time with your team.**

Case study: **[How To Semi-Nomad](/semi-nomad){:target="_blank"}** – a 200-page illustrated book created with cards by a group of 14 people in 55 hours with zero AI use.

- **Host immersive experiences creating playful interactions**

Case study: **[Wild Cards](https://wildcards.gg/#wildcards){:target="_blank"}** – 44 cards designed to create fun and connection in any context – from a productive business meeting all the way to exciting date night.

## Let's Build Your Deck

I'll take you through the process resulting in your very own printed card deck ready for distribution.

TLDR:

**1. Build Your Card Deck**<br>
**2. Ship it to the World**

The journey includes:

- **Deck framing** – what is your deck about and what makes it special?
- **Deck mechanics** – how does your deck utilise cards as a medium to deliver engaging experience?
- **Card creation** – what are the highest impact cards in your deck?
- **Card design** – how do the cards look like?
- **Production** – printing cards and putting them into beautiful pouches.
- **Product launch** – pricing, marketing, launch and distribution support.

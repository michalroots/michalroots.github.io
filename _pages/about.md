I create **experiences** and **games** that accelerate the transition towards a **regenerative way of living**, on an individual and planetary scale. + document the process.

🌳✨⛵️

Choose wisely:

1. Play a [game](/games).
2. Let's [make a podcast](/podcast).
3. (Very) [serious cv, bio, and selected body of ~~work~~ play](bio).

✨

**You can hire me as a [flowplay facilitator](/experiences)** for your project/org/event. I play with people creating positive impact in the world (even if my business coach says that this is not specific enough 🥺). You can think of me as a **wizard sherpa** committed to help you climb your Vision Mountain. I'll bring my  superpowers: creativity, energy, multimedia and play.

First step is easy.

If you're curious about my personal journey, read my [Moonly Reviews](/moonly-reviews) or watch [Moonly Videos](/moonly-video). Moonly rhythms are dope.

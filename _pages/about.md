I'm a **facilitation artist** and a **catalyst wizard**, **co-creating a beautiful world where all Beings can thrive**.

✨

Superpowers: [cards](/cards), inspiring aliveness, serious fun.

I am currently **based in Amsterdam** - studying the nautical arts at the [**Enkhuizer Zeevaartschool**](https://ezsenglish.weebly.com/). **Sailing is my medicine**.

⛵️

**My home is in Pico Island**, a forest sanctuary on the Atlantic Circuit, where I [document community processes](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc){:target="_blank"}, and in [**Traditional Dream Factory**](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target="_blank"}, where we're building a model for regenerative co-living while having a lot of fun.

🌳

I'm a member of [**Enspiral**](https://enspiral.com){:target="_blank"} - a global network of people helping each other to do more meaningful work. 

See you around!

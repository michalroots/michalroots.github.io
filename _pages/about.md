**Co-creating a beautiful world where all Beings can thrive.**

✨

Currently **based in Amsterdam**. Mastering the [**art of Cards**](/cards){:target="_blank"} as culture building blocks. Studying sailing at the [**Enkhuizer Zeevaartschool**](https://ezsenglish.weebly.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Vision: 

**Connect land-based positive impact projects with sailing routes and co-create regenerative expeditions at sea**.

⛵️

**My home is in Pico Island**, where we're building a forest sanctuary immersed within a [thriving community](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc){:target="_blank"} - conveniently located on the major sailing route of the world. **My second home is in the [Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target="_blank"}**, where we're building a model for regenerative co-living while having a lot of fun.


🌳

I'm a member of [**Enspiral**](https://enspiral.com){:target="_blank"} - a global network of people helping each other to do more meaningful work.

See you around!

<b>Pilgrim of Light, Shapeshifting Racoon and Forest Guardian in Training.</b>

🌳

**Microsolidarity** practitioner.

Multidisciplinary **artist**.

**Aquarius** with Gemini Ascendant.

I like maps, writting **letters** and building structures from wood. 

**Sailing** is when I feel the most alive.

This website is my digital **journal** (and more).

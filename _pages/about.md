excerpt: Michał creates experiences and games that accelerate transition towards a regenerative way of living.

I'm a **facilitation artist** and a **catalyst wizard**, co-creating a world where all Beings can thrive ✨.

My friends call me a **Wizard**. Ask me to show you my **Cards - an ecosystem of playful facilitating tools**. That's my superpower.

I am currently **based in Amsterdam** - studying at the [**Enkhuizer Zeevaartschool**](https://ezsenglish.weebly.com/), to obtain my professional license for (laaaarge) sailing vessels. **Sailing is my medicine**.

**My home is in Pico Island**. I'm living in a tiny house in the middle of a beautiful forest and weave ([and document](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc){:target="_blank"}) a neighbourhood community.

I'm a member of [**Enspiral**](https://enspiral.com){:target="_blank"} - a global network of people helping each other to do more meaningful work, and [**Traditional Dream Factory**](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target="_blank"} - a regenerative village in Portugal.

See you around!

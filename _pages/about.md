**Co-creating a beautiful world where all Beings can thrive.**

✨

Currently **based in Amsterdam**. Studying sailing at the [**Enkhuizer Zeevaartschool**](https://ezsenglish.weebly.com/){:target="_blank"} and creating a playful facilitation ecosystem powered by [Cards](/cards){:target="_blank"}.

Vision: 

**Co-create regenerative expeditions at sea connecting positive impact projects.**

⛵️

**My home is in the Azores**, where we're building a forest sanctuary immersed within a [thriving community](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc){:target="_blank"} - conveniently located on the major sailing route of the world. 

**My second home is in the [Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target="_blank"}**, where we're building a model for regenerative co-living while having a lot of fun.

🌳

I'm a member of [**Enspiral**](https://enspiral.com){:target="_blank"} - a global network of people helping each other to do more meaningful work.

📖

I co-wrote a book "[How to Build a Regenerative Village](https://treehousedao.earth/)" - the **actionable manual** accelerating the transition towards a **regenerative way of living**, on an **individual and planetary scale**.

## Areas of research

- Sailing and facilitation at sea
- Experience design, facilitation, adventure guiding
- Journaling and documentation
- Play as superpower for creativity
- Pattern breaking
- Cards as building blocks of culture

## Card Wizard, at Your Service 🧙‍♂️

I'm a facilitation artist creating **playful co-creation experiences for events and organisations**. Shall we [play together](/play-together){:target="_blank"}?

If you're curious about my personal journey, read my [Moonly Reviews](/moonly-reviews) or watch [Moonly Videos](/moonly-video). Moonly rhythms are dope.

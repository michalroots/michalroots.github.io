excerpt: Michał creates experiences and games that accelerate transition towards a regenerative way of living.
---

I'm a **facilitation artist** and a **playful wizard**, catalysing the **regenerative movement** through **serious games**, **co-creation experiences** and **open source documentation**.

I'm building and documenting [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com){:target="_blank"}, [Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com){:target="_blank"}, and [Microsolidarity in Pico](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc){:target="_blank"}.

**Sailing** is my medicine.

## Areas of research

- Co-creation through play
- Community weaving
- Pattern breaking
- Non-negotiable commitments
- Radical self-reliance
- Facilitation at sea

## Let's play together!

**You can hire me as a [facilitator](/facilitation){:target="_blank"}, play [cards](/cards){:target="_blank"}, or check out my open source [documentation](/documentation){:target="_blank"}**.

If you're curious about my personal journey, read my [Moonly Reviews](/moonly-reviews) or watch [Moonly Videos](/moonly-video). Moonly rhythms are dope.

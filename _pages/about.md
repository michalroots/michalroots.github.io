I'm a **facilitator** and a **documentation wizard**, building and documenting [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com), [Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com), and [Microsolidarity in Pico](https://pico.microsolidarity.cc).

I'm passionate about **regeneration**, **learning by doing** and **play as the source of flow**. 

**Sailing** is my medicine.

🌳✨⛵️

You can **hire me as a facilitator**, or **book a consulting call**. Here's my (very) [serious cv, bio, and selected body of ~~work~~ play](bio).

Alternatively, check out my [games and courses](/games) for personal regeneration and co-creation.

If you're curious about my personal journey, read my [Moonly Reviews](/moonly-reviews) or watch [Moonly Videos](/moonly-video). Moonly rhythms are dope.

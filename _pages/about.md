I create **[experiences](/experiences){:target="_blank"}** and **[games](/games){:target="_blank"}** that accelerate the transition towards a **regenerative way of living**, on an individual and planetary scale.

ðŸ”†

Background: **facilitation** + **multidisciplinary art** + **sailing**

Current Homes: **Pico Island** (Azores) + **Traditional Dream Factory** (regenerative village in Portugal)

North Star: **Let's co-create a beautiful world where all Beings can thrive** âœ¨

This website is my digital **playground**.

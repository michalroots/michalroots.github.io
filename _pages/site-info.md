summary: A few geeky details for digital ninjas and forest elders.

**This website is my digital garden, journal, archive, portfolio, playground and open documentation of stuff I do.** 

I had this crazy idea for a while to put it all in one place, and I finally managed to manifest it, which is a huge victory because I'm a recovering perfectionist who doesn't know how to code. <br>

Pow ✨.

## Tech Stack
I'm designing this website for effortless publishing from Obsidian. Here's my [documentation](/obsidian-to-github) of making this possible.

- Code written in <a href="https://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets</a>
- Coded (awkwardly) by me in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>
- Started with <a href="https://github.com/ronv/sidey" target="_blank">Sidey theme</a>
- Hosted on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>
- Deployed by <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>

## The Future
- ~~Publish the website~~

I create **experiences** where magic happens, weaving **In-Real-Life** spaces with **Creation** and **Play**.

My role is to create a space where people **feel safe to play**.

Through embodying **full presence**, **modelling behaviour**, and **open-hearted connection**, I **tune the group into a harmonious super-organism** encouraging **co-creation of magickal moments and tangible artefacts** from the place of playfulness. **Play is the ultimate flow state**. And I'm all about **Serious Fun**.

In my work I combine over a **decade of experience** with **facilitation in diverse contexts** and **multidisciplinary arts** (performing, visual, narrative, and more).

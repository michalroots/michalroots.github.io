**I (co-)create experiences and spaces where magic happens.**

Gatherings, immersive performances, cohort based courses, parties, exhibitions, sailing trips, sharing circles, workshops, trainings, retreats, weddings ... you name it. 

My personal *ikigai* is bringing people together into a container and holding space for *relational transformation*. Relational = in relationship with other people and the container itself.

It all started with my mother bringing me to a winter retreat of a theatre group at the age of one, which escalated into a Film and Media degree, and numerous exhibitions, performances, and art-based experiences, which I continue to create with delight.

At the age of eighteen I've started organising events and facilitating teams on international exchanges and European Youth Parliament sessions. Since then, I've been practicing the future of work by co-creating within a creative partnership studio Honeyboom, Enspiral, Traditional Dream Factory, and Lethally Harmless Productions. I'm a community weaver and catalyst in Pico Island, working towards Azores Regenerative Network. Also: a certified habit coach.

My work is inspired by heart-to-heart connections, nature and playfulness. I love contact improvisation, hiking for hours, and sailing at night under star-covered sky. These moments of awe make me feel alive, and fuel my aspiration to co-create a beautiful world where all Beings can thrive.

Thank you for Being ✨
Michał

## A friend shared with me recently:

> "so nice to have you part of these circles. I honor your being & presence! making things deeper and lighter at the same time"

It touched me deeply.

Here are some other words about my work:

YOP
Pico
TDF

> “I’ve made my year in review as always to close this year. Going through my calendar, the series of events, feelings and insights that I had, I realized how much of a great impact your work had on the positive outcome of my year. **I’m slowly changing to become the person I would like to be. You gave me tools for that, by putting your heart in sharing your own life and learnings openly, as a coach, as a mentor, as a person.**“  
– Flora Koczka; _Wise_

> “The way I move, breathe, see and hear changed drastically already and it all started through realising I am feeling disconnected and need to sense into my feet. So small but so incredibly powerful. **I am beyond grateful for you all helping me realising how things can change and to what extend.**  
– Alina Manko; _Enspiral & Open Collective_

> “After reading your newsletter this week I wanted to encourage you about the wonderful journey I see you following. I am not sure how or what your future looks like in regards to your business, but I do see two people with a genuine heart wanting to help and serve people. Your life choices are influencing others to live a more mindful and wholesome lifestyle. I love being a part of it in the small way that I am because it helps me to see the two of you, living how you are. We do not always know how all the parts will come together, but as a friend told me once, keep doing all the things you are directed to do and somehow everything meshes the way it should. She was right and my journey continues as yours will too! You are both so inspiring and wonderful people. I am so lucky to have crossed paths with you and I hope you will continue in whatever you feel is next!”
> – Claire Ducharme (about my work with my partner at Honeyboom)

> “I am DEEPLY grateful for your program. **I am on day 140 of yoga daily and day 74 of meditating every day.** It’s making such a difference in EVERYTHING.”  
– Cathy Hutchison; _Idibri & Your Visual Journal_

> “The structure of the calls is highly effective. The facilitation brilliantly mixes different ways to participate so that whether you are creative or logical, extroverted or introverted, quick to react or slower to process, there is space for you. I find these calls so valuable that I have adapted the format to use with the group that I am mentoring.”
— Cathy Hutchison, Founder at Your Visual Journal

> “The Routine Bootcamp was a very impactful way to reflect on my routines and get the support I needed to change them. Sharing with others helped me understand my needs better, and helped with accountability and motivation. This was such a great way to get over roadblocks and improve my life!”
– Irem Tumer, UNFPA

> “When we formed this Writers’ Smart Pod I did not expect that our first six weeks of Zoom meetings would be so insightful, energy-giving, and productive. You designed the program with enough flexibility to meet our particular needs and working preferences, and the right amount of structure and guidance for us to form an effective cohort to move our projects forward. More important, as you have pointed out, are the relationships we have formed.
> 
> I’m happy with what I’ve produced and the breakthroughs I’ve had. Now I wouldn’t want to continue with my project without these guys on the path with me. This is the most valuable and satisfying working group I’ve been a part of in a long time. I heartily encourage anyone who is thinking of working with you to just do it, for the creative and productive value and for the positive experience.”
– Deanna Vogt; Executive Coach

## Notes of Appreciation
(Do you have something to add? [I’d love to hear from you](https://airtable.com/appNEX1RiQIQQqAPw/shr50rHuJXh5iuo5n){:target="_blank"}!)

> *"You are my first choice when it comes to cool **facilitation that can be equally fun and professional.**"*<br>
> – Ani Anca, Traditional Dream Factory
<br><br>

>*"**What you accomplished with the mastermind is INCREDIBLE**. We always tell people how gifted you are at facilitating and keeping the energy flowing. **We don’t know anyone who could’ve done what you did.**"*<br> 
>– Laura van Wijngaarden, Liminal Village
<br><br>

>*"**I have not been a part of such an integrated group for years!**"*<br>
>– Darya Agapitov, Sailing Expedition Participant
<br><br>

>*“I've made my year in review as always to close this year. Going through my calendar, the series of events, feelings and insights that I had, **I realized how much of a great impact your work had on the positive outcome of my year. I'm slowly changing to become the person I would like to be. You gave me tools for that**, by putting your heart in sharing your own life and learnings openly, as a coach, as a mentor, as a person."*<br>
>– Flora Kóczka, participant of multiple learning programs
<br><br>

>*"**Your vibe hygiene is impeccable***"<br>
>– Rich Bartlett, participant of a card deck building mastermind
<br><br>

>*“The structure of the calls is highly effective. **The facilitation brilliantly mixes different ways to participate so that whether you are creative or logical, extroverted or introverted, quick to react or slower to process, there is space for you**. I find these calls so valuable that I have adapted the format to use with the group that I am mentoring.”*<br>
>– Cathy Hutchison, participant of a year-long learning program
<br><br>

>*“**The whole course was astonishing (I'd rate it a 10)**. The lessons were so well thought out and Michał and Silvia are amazing coaches who deeply care about the person in front of them.”*<br>
>— Merle Pohl; Online course participant
<br><br>

>*"**I appreciated your playfulness throughout the whole process :)** it made everything feel approachable and fun!"*<br>
>Jesse Evers, participant of a card deck building mastermind
<br><br>

>*“When we formed this Writers’ Smart Pod **I did not expect that our first six weeks of Zoom meetings would be so insightful, energy-giving, and productive**. You designed the program with enough flexibility to meet our particular needs and working preferences, and the right amount of structure and guidance for us to form an effective cohort to move our projects forward. More important, as you have pointed out, are the relationships we have formed.*<br>
>– Deanna Vogt; Writing program participant

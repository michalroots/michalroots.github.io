Letters are magic.

Part of the magic unfolds through the experience of the deep connected state, as the writter externalises their subconscious patterns through words. Letters take long enough to write, allowing for depth and insight. And the profound moment encapsulated in a letter, has the power of creating deep connection between the writer and reader, whether it's the same person or not.

But the process doesn't end there. 

The letter can, usually, be engaged with again, and again, and again, bringing another moment of connection into the world.

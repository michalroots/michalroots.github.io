1. [Play cards](/cards) with me.
2. Let's [make a podcast](/podcast).
3. (Very) [serious cv, bio, and selected body of ~~work~~ play](bio).

✨

**You can hire me as a [flowstate facilitator](/flowplay)** for your project and/or yourself. I play with positive impact orgs and their founders. You can think of me as a **wizard sherpa** committed to support the epic climb of your Vision Mountain, with my superpowers: **catalysing energy**, **community weaving**, installing **artful rhythms**, and, of course, **play**.

🌳

If you're curious in my personal journey, read my [Moonly Reviews](/moonly-reviews) or watch [Moonly Videos](/moonly-video). Moonly rhythms are dope 🌕🌑.

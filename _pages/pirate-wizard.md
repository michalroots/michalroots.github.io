title: Pirate Wizard Looking for a Home in the Netherlands
excerpt: Micha≈Ç is about to study to become a professional pirate. Help!

Ahoy there!

It is so, that **Micha≈Ç (that'd be me) decided to become a professional pirate** - **and enrolled into the [Enkhuizer Zeevaartschool](https://ezsenglish.weebly.com/){:target="_blank"} (Netherlands)** - the world's finest School of the Nautical Arts training tall ship crew.

What's a tall ship, you ask?

( ‚òùÔ∏è That's the courtyard of the school, and my very, very excited self. )

## I'm looking for a Home for my studies (Oct 23 - Apr 24)

Ideal match:

- **a sailboat / houseboat / RV that could use a winter steward**.  
- **a house sit**
- **a good, old-fashioned rental**, although my budget is rather thin for Dutch market prices.
- **a house swap** with the [Wizard Cabin](/cabin){:target="_blank"} in the woods or 1 bed epic house in Pico Island.
- open to other options - you name it!

**Location: Amsterdam / Enkhuizen / somewhere around**. The school is located in Enkhuizen and I need to be there only one day per week, the rest is study time at home - so I can travel further for ideal match.

üè°

**I'm a pirate wizard living in Pico Island (Azores) and building a Forest Sanctuary and a Pirate Base.** I've been here for 3 years+, supporting local projects and creating a gift economy allowing people to thrive with minimal reliance on financial capital (growing food, sharing resources).

Professionally, **I create relational growth experiences and catalyse groups to unlock their creative potential**. I work with positive impact projects, such as:

- **Traditional Dream Factory** - a regenerative coliving in Portugal
- **Enspiral** - a global network helping people do more meaningful work
- **Treehouse DAO** - a regenerative publishing studio

‚õµÔ∏è

**I'm enrolling into a pro sailing school to move forward on my journey to host transformational experiences at sea and connect positive impact projects worldwide with a fleet of sailboats**. Plus, personally speaking, sailing is when I feel the most alive.

üíú  
  
**I'd be super grateful for any leads & divine connections. Please send them my way!**  
  
Wishing you a beautiful day!  
Micha≈Ç

**I organise unforgettable voyages aboard epic sailing ships.**

**Sailing ships are unique venues.** 

Immerse yourself in nature, practice real-world collaboration, and experience why humans have been exploring our planet by sea since the dawn of time.

Yes – it's as good as in the movies.

## No passengers, only crew.

**Who are you sailing with defines your adventure.**

I'm an experience designer, facilitator, and a professional sailor. I curate the crew to ensure high sense of harmony, friendship, and fun. We learn how to **sail the ship together, witness awe-inspiring nature, and turn dreams into memories** that will last a lifetime.

We're all in this together!

## I graduated from the worlds leading nautical college and sailed over 8000 nautical miles.

I am an Enkhuizeer Zeevaartschool graduate, training to become an officer on sailing ships up to 500 tonnes. I have a full set of professional certificates, including STCW Basic Safety, First Aid, and RYA SRC.

I've sailed with one-of-a-kind ships like Tecla, Twister, Grayhound, Chateauroux and Atyla, as well as Azorean whaling boats, holopuni sailing canoes, and modern yachts.

Now it's your turn!

## Your vision, ship-ified.

Do you have a concept that wants to live at sea?  
  
**I help facilitators, leaders, and creatives shape their vision into seaworthy voyages** – and bring them to life onboard. I will help you translate your idea into the reality of a ship, connect you to the right vessel, and support you as a co-facilitator. **From transformational retreats to teambuilding events**, the sea will make your event unforgettable.

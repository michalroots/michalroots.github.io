## Current Goal
- **Getting ready for studying in [Enkhuizer Zeevaartschool](https://ezsenglish.weebly.com/){:target="_blank"} **
- Looking to crew in Spring / Summer 2023.
- Prototyping *Melting Man* - a regenerative burn at sea.

## Long Term Goal

**My long term goal is to sail between regenerative projects and host experiences at sea.** The journey starts with connecting my forest home in Pico (Azores) and *Traditional Dream Factory* in Mainland Portugal. What's next?

**I am looking to expand my offshore sailing experience**, particularly in passage planning, navigation, difficult weather conditions and yacht maintenance.

## About¬†
**Sailing is my medicine**, and it's when I feel the most alive. You might find me singing shanties madly in a pouring rain, and then to delight you with a delicious dessert when you least expect it. 

**Professionally, I create events** (gatherings, workshops, performances, courses...) **and write stories.** Some are decent. I seem to be very good at **bringing people together, holding space and catalysing** the energy in the room to co-create magic together. Here's where I [focus](/focus){:target="_blank"} at the moment.

**I'm high vibe, positive, and proactive**. I love heart-to-heart conversations and give memorable hugs (bold statement, I know). I like to **travel light** - less than 80l.

- Languages: Polish (native), English (fluent),¬†Portuguese (intermediate), French (intermediate)
- Nationality:¬†Polish (EU passport) 
- Dream: co-creating a beautiful world where all beings can thrive.
- Diet: no animals for me, but I don't mind you eating yours.
- Non-smoker

Also:

- Very fit and agile (and happy to climb masts)
- Resilient
- Easy going, happy vibe, relaxed mindset
- Quick learner
- Responds well in challenging situations
- Good cook (specialising in: vegetarian, vegan and desserts that will delight you)

In other words, good catch üíú

<img src="/assets/michal-wizard-bounce.jpg" alt="Micha≈Ç Facilitator" style="width:80%;">      

<p>

I'm a <b>catalyst</b>, <b>performing artist</b> and <b>sailor</b>. <br>
My friends call me a <b>Wizard</b>.
    
</p>

<p>

    I specialise in <b>facilitating in-person co-creation events</b>, such as an 11-day mastermind where we wrote a book <i><a href="https://treehousedao.earth" target="_blank">"How to Build a Regenerative Village"</a></i>, documented extensively in this <a href="https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1565240255564980225" target="_blank">this twitter thread</a>. I'm hosting another edition in October 2024 focused on <a href="https://www.vermonthub.ch/mastermind" target="_blank">Building Belonging as Semi-Nomads</a>.
  
</p>

<p>

<b>I work with positive impact organisations and projects</b>. Here are my current roles:

<ul>
        <li>European representative of the social impact collective <a href="https://enspiral.com" target="_blank">Enspiral</a>
        <li>Member & Steward Alumni of a regenerative village <a href="https://traditionaldreamfactory.com" target="_blank">Traditional Dream Factory</a>
        <li>Lead facilitator of a publishing studio <a href="https://treehousedao.earth/" target="_blank">Treehouse DAO</a>
        <li>Co-captain of a Nowhere Burn camp <a href="https://sheepyship.carrd.co/" target="_blank"> Sheepy Ship</a>
</ul>

</p>



<h2>Sailing Expeditions ‚õµÔ∏è</h2>

<p>

<b>I gather crews for tale-worthy sailing expeditions with a long-term mission of connecting land-based projects by sea</b>. I've graduated from <a href="https://ezsenglish.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Enkhuizer Zeevaartschool</a> and I'm working towards a commercial license for sailing ships up to 500 tons. Here's my <a href="/sailing" target="_blank">sailing page</a>.

</p>

<h2>Wild Cards üÉè </h2>

<p>

    Cards are my favourite medium. <b>I host interactive journeys of art and magic</b> powered by a unique deck of cards <b>designed to create meaningful interactions with a dash of playful spirit</b>. Welcome to the world of <a href="https://wildwizards.xyz" target="_blank">Wild Wizards</a>!

</p>

<h2>Journaling üìñ</h2>

<p>

    Journal is my playground. <b>I've developed a myriad of <a href="https://journalsmarter.com" target="_blank">journaling tools</a></b>, including a visual journaling system which became a cornerstone of my consistent daily journaling practice since 2015 - the <a href="https://infinitysquares.xyz/" target="_blank">Infinity Squares</a>.

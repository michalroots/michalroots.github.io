I'm a **community catalyst**, **performing artist** and **sailor**. My friends call me a **Wizard**.

I work with **positive impact organisations**, such as [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com) and [Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com), **enabling playful co-creation** and **hosting spaces of deep connection**.

I specialise in **using cards to create meaningful interactions and tangible deliverables**, such as "*[How to Build a Regenerative Village](https://treehousedao.earth)*" - a book created during an 11-day mastermind, with the process documented live in this twitter thread. LINK
## Catalyst Wizard, At Your Service üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You can invite me for a **residency** or book a **consulting** conversation.

ACTION

## Wild Cards üÉè

 I created a unique [Card Wizard Experience](https://wildwizards.xyz) using a deck of cards designed to create meaningful interactions, with a dash of playful mischief. The limited edition of 50 decks comes with cards illustrated by [Silvia](https://silviamakesdrawings.com) in pouches handcrafted by [Juliana](https://)Made in Europe, with no plastic. LINK.

            "content_text": "Let‚Äôs begin with a bit of context:I‚Äôve been location independent from 2017 and I absolutely love the freedom of being able to move whenever I feel it‚Äôs the right time to do it. There is however a price to pay for that freedom: the pain of saying goodbye to people dear to your heart, knowing that you might never see them again, because life is unpredictable.I admit, that there were times during my travels when I felt quite lonely. I did encounter many wonderful Souls, and the connections were intense but also short. I lacked continuity.One day I decided to make a list of people I intuitively felt like reaching out to. Some were close friends, and others were people I shared a single powerful moment sometime, somewhere. The following day I sent them all a message.Some people replied and we had a call, others replied and that was it. Some never replied at all. I considered it a ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù. There‚Äôs time and space for each connection. No hard feelings. With some people however I felt a clear ‚Äúconnection match‚Äù and some developed into beautiful friendships.The next step was to experiment with different frequencies for calls. I found that different intervals work better for each relationship ‚Äì the rarer the call, the more ‚Äúmacro‚Äù the perspective. With some people it feels more natural to stay close to each other and reflect together on things that are alive right now, and with others it feels wonderful to look together at an entire year of our lives and share whatever comes up to the surface.In the process, I also discovered that I generally prefer audio-only calls. Video is nice, but I‚Äôd rather go for a walk rather than stare at a computer screen. With time, I gravitated towards async connections, such as long voice-notes, emails and letters.In a few months, I eradicated the feeling of loneliness, and nurtured myself with recurring 1:1 conversations with people I love.Microsolidarity ExperimentsDiscovering microsolidarity in the beginning of 2020 was a huge milestone for me.Microsolidarity gave me vocabulary to operate with and served as a practical guide to weaving wonderful social interactions at a bigger scale, with a possibility of changing the world together.Three ideas really struck a deeper chord:1) People before projects ‚Äì&gt; start with finding the people that you can co-create magic with2) Different group sizes serve different purposes ‚Äì&gt; large groups serve as a ‚Äúdating pool‚Äù to find your small groups where the magic happens3) Verbs &gt; Nouns ‚Äì&gt; theory is useful, but focus on the practiceI sat down and made another list.I let the names sink in for some time, feeling into small groups that would make sense to call into existence. When it felt right, I reached out to some people with an idea of launching ‚Äúmastermind groups‚Äù (which was the vocabulary more familiar to the people I was reaching out to).Here‚Äôs a part of an email exchange with one of the people I reached out to, introducing the idea of co-creating a group.Over the next few months I launched a few crews:  The Unicorns ü¶Ñ - digital, 4 people (2 couples), mutual support, March 2020 - January 2021  Team Angie ‚ö°Ô∏è - digital, 4 people, exploring different topics, emotional development, May 2020 - May 2021  Loverz Powerz üíú - digital, 4 people (2 couples), relationship-focused, May 2020 - May 2021  Routine Bootcamp üöÄ - digital, 3 people, building routines together based on Metagame Mastermind Format (youtube video), June - November 2020  The Circle ‚ö™Ô∏è - presential, 4 housemates, weekly sharing circle followed by a co-living talk, February - June 2020  Pico Sharing Circle üåÄ - presential, ~10 people, bi-weekly sharing circle, which eventually grew into an entire congregation. Here‚Äôs the documentation of the circle.A few reflections:  While I took the responsibility of being the caller (the person who calls the pod to existence),** I deliberately let go of my default facilitating posture and practiced co-creating together.** The crews usually started with one or two ‚Äúmeta calls‚Äù diving into our intentions and deciding how do we want to be together, including technicalities such as rhythm, format etc.  Crews had a timeframe agreed in advance. Each cycle was closed with a retrospective when we decided what‚Äôs the next step, for example closing the crew or beginning another cycle.  Even if we committed to the schedule set up in advance, there was always at least one call that we had to skip due to life being life (na-na-na-na-na). Pods tended to work better with meetings no further than one month apart.  Keeping a recording was kinda useless, but we all enjoyed sharing our notes with each other  I kept a log of each pod for learning purposes. I‚Äôm very grateful that I did, because I‚Äôm looking at them as I write this article.  I loved the process of coming up with the crew name together.üëÅ Key Insight:Start your microsolidarity journey by calling a crew (or a couple of them). Today is a perfect day to do it. You‚Äôll learn all the skills you need along the way, and who knows - your crew(s) might eventually grow into a congregation.Check out the resources at the end of this article if you need some extra help.EnspiralIn September 2021 I joined Enspiral, a network of people helping each other do more meaningful work. The network design includes pods (equivalent to crews *in microslidarity lingo) to support building relationships within the network. While I haven‚Äôt joined any pods, mostly due to all the other crews I had going on at the time, I got involved in *Enspiral Europe Connection Working Group ‚Äì a small group hosting bi-weekly Connection Calls for Enspiralites based in Europe.  Write documentation of the formats tried in EECC and publish in the Enspiral Handbook.Growing a congregation in Pico IslandWhat happened in Pico surpassed my wildest dreams.In a bit over one year since our very first sharing circle, we hosted two community gatherings, launch numerous projects, and created a strong foundation for a thriving congregation.The most surprising part is that it was actually quite simple. I called a sharing circle, and as people started to spend time getting to know each other on a deeper level, magic started to happen. Of course, as we‚Äôre maturing as a congregation we‚Äôll encounter challenges. That‚Äôs just a part of the process. With a strong foundation of relationships based on trust, care and support, we‚Äôre ready for our next iterations.I‚Äôll document the process thoroughly here.üëÅ Key insight:It seems that at this point I became a microsolidarity practitioner and a congregation catalyst. I attribute my progress to two core competencies developed over time:1) practicing crewing ‚Äì&gt; there‚Äôs no learning without practice, and no amount of theory will teach you how to be and co-create together with the real people around you.2) documenting the process ‚Äì&gt; publishing my process as an open-source documentation allowed me to regularly reflect on my learning journey. It also created beautiful connections with people who reached out to me with appreciation, questions, feedback and co-creating possibilities.If there‚Äôs one advice I could give to a microsolidarity beginner, it‚Äôs to do these two things from the start. I‚Äôm available to help if you could benefit from it.Looking Beyond PicoIn June 2021 I felt a call to connect with Faial, one of the neighbour islands. As I hiked through its forests and volcanoes, I realised that the most wonderful thing about Pico (for me) is that it is a part of an archipelago containing nine islands, each with its own unique energy and people.One reason why I love islands, is that each of them feels like an entire world. While clearly limited by water and no matter how small, it also feels infinite. There‚Äôs just so much to explore. I guess you can tell where I‚Äôm going with this. The Azores is not just one world ‚Äì it‚Äôs a Galaxy.I guess it comes without surprise that my next step is to catalyse Azores Regenerative Network, and plant microsolidarity seeds in all islands, while integrating it with my life-long dream of sailing.The soil is fertile and the people are already doing the Work.Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs going to sprout from the seeds that we are planting together.üå±GratitudeThis post wouldn‚Äôt be complete without expressing my deepest gratitude to Rich Bartlett (twitter link) for compiling Microsolidarity and supporting countless people and projects around the world to co-create a beautiful world where all Beings can thrive üíú.Also, a wholehearted hug goes to everyone with whom I got to practice microsolidarity together.

Publish to Github without friction.(Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt know how to code)Installing Jekyll on MacOS MojaveIt was a pain in the ass, but it worked eventually.I needed:  Basic knowledge of Mac Terminal  Read through the official installation guide from Jekyll  And another simpler guide  Finally, spent a long time troubleshooting errors I couldn‚Äôt understand. Here‚Äôs the most succint solution that worked for me. Note: I had to run bundle update before and after other commands. No idea why, but it works now.To preview the website locally:  launch terminal and navigate to the folder with the site using  cd ~/PATHTOFOLDER  serve jekyll with Bundle exec jekyll serve  open http://localhost:4000 in your browserUploading Code to GithubThat was easy, because I did this before, and Github has a good manual on how to do it.  I created a new repository called &lt;username&gt;.github.io  I cloned the empty repository from Github to my computer using Github Desktop  I copied the contents of the website I have been editing on my computer to the github folder and pushed changes to Github.The website is now live at heymichal.github.io, but there are still a few things to do.Editing with ObsidianOpen the local folder with my github page as a vault in obsidian. That was super easy. I‚Äôm now editing this post in Obsidian, then commit changes and merge via Github desktop.Note that it takes some time for the changes to appear on the live site.üí° I later moved the entire local folder with my site into a /web folder inside my main obsidian vault.Setting up NetlifyThe next step is to fix tags not working at all on the site. I suppose it‚Äôs because of some incompatibility between the template I started with and Github pages. I know that the template was using Netlify to deploy the site, so I guess I‚Äôll do the same.Super easy and works like a charm.  I added a new site from git  pointed to my repository with the site on git  deployedI now have a funky netlify url: https://sleepy-mahavira-46dee4.netlify.app/ which I can change into a custom domain with SSL, which is the obvious next step.I also tested the speed of publishing and it works instantly. I edit in Obsidian, push with Github Desktop and it‚Äôs live.The only trouble is that images don‚Äôt seem to be showing at all in previews on social media (I‚Äôm using this tool and twitter card validator to test). I checked the YAML frontmatter and it all seems fine to my eye:layout: post title: The Red Caped Girl description: The magic happens when I tune into myself. image: /assets/touch-of-universe.jpg tags: [letters] and yet, I keep getting this error:og:image can't be found at the defined URLI‚Äôll troubleshoot it later.Setting up custom domainThis was quite straightforward, even if the manual from Netlify was a bit overwhelming.Set up custom domain, when you get the new DNS configuration login to your domain registrar and setup the new DNS configuration, and then wait for some time for the website to show up at the new address. It took around 2 hours in my case, and the site is now operational!üéâTroubleshooting SSL CertificateIt turns out that while the site was live, something didn‚Äôt work with the automatic SSL encryption. I went to domain settings in Netlify, clicked on ‚Äúrenew certificate‚Äù and less than a minute later it was working properly.Optimising Obsidian &lt;&gt; Github FlowFor now I‚Äôve been using a separate obsidian vault for my website, but actually, why not keep it all together?I‚Äôve created a new folder /web in my main obsidian vault and I moved the folder with website files heymichal.github.io inside.",

I edit in Obsidian, push with Github Desktop and it‚Äôs live.</p><p>The only trouble is that images don‚Äôt seem to be showing at all in previews on social media (I‚Äôm using <a href=\"https://socialsharepreview.com/\" target=\"_blank\">this tool</a> and <a href=\"https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator\" target=\"_blank\">twitter card validator</a> to test).

That‚Äôs the hard part.Oppressing, repressing, suppressing, pretending it‚Äôs not there, numbing, distracting, and other clever strategies can work in the short run, but ultimately Fear awaits to be acknowledged head on and embraced, like any other being on this planet.Once accepted, it looses it‚Äôs paralyzing power. allowing for a deep wholehearted hug.With the heart truly open, no Fear can be.",

Fear of being judged.</p><p>With so many fears, it‚Äôs not surprising that each and every one of us is a mess, in their very unique and irrepeatable way. And yet, Fear can be overcomed, just like any pattern, no matter how deep, can be rewritten.</p><p>For me, the process starts with noticing the Fear, creeping in the deep ocean of the subconscious mind, and bringing it up t the surface of awareness. And then ‚Äì embrace it. That‚Äôs the hard part.</p><p>Oppressing, repressing, suppressing, pretending it‚Äôs not there, numbing, distracting, and other clever strategies can work in the short run, but ultimately Fear awaits to be acknowledged head on and embraced, like any other being on this planet.</p><p>Once accepted, it looses it‚Äôs paralyzing power. allowing for a deep wholehearted hug.</p><p>With the heart truly open, no Fear can be.</p>",

It‚Äôs been a while.But here it gets interesting:The life, a curious mistress, teaches me that I both can and can‚Äôt have what I want, which while being a profound guidance is also some fucking conflicting advice.To elaborate:In one moment I connect to the infinite cosmic reality, the ‚ÄúBig We‚Äù, as my friend calls it, and manifest any reality I choose, provided I‚Äôm specific enough to verbalize it and put it out there into the Universe, ideally out loud while facing one of the raw elements in the time when specific celestial bodies align. But to be fair, any space can become sacred if only treated with appropriate reverence.The flow is a blessed state to be in for sure, and yet, it tends to end abruptly without notice, leaving me confused, disconnected, and lonely. Still waiting for the magical girl to appear, caress my back without warning, look deeply at me, and deliberately kiss my neck slowly to see what happens.I can feel the shivers. But, whether I like it or not, it is not the reality, at least not in this very moment. Feel free to prove me wrong though.As I sit with myself, unfolding knots tangled over the light shining from within, I feel, yet again, the conflicting advice of the Universe and it‚Äôs teachers.I could remain still, witnessing my feelings arise and pass away in the infinite flow of impermanence, both blissful and difficult to accept, especially at times when the conscious choice of letting go is particularly hard. I know you‚Äôve been there.I could also act upon this very moment, and instead of waiting for the magic to happen, create the magic myself, with a not-so-litte help of the Universe, provided it‚Äôs a day when Good Fortune smiles at my cute attempts of seducing a powerful woman.It‚Äôs difficult, because as I sit still with this process happening inside of me, and become conscious of it as I write it down, and now, although it‚Äôs a very scary thought, sharing it out loud with you, I feel that I‚Äôm growing inside, slowly, awkwardly, and with a fair degree of metaphysical pain, but ultimately becoming a person that is more aware and therefore loving.This process of growth feels important to go through, so that‚Äôs probably why I am still here, right in the middle of this mess of myself, dying along with my unfulfilled desires, and reviving along with another moment given to me to experience.What a gift to be able to live this very conflict. To Be, still and motionless, witnessing what is and Being with it‚Ä¶ or not.This power of deliberately changing my mindset gives me shivers, too.I‚Äôm still here, making space for the magical girl to touch my soul and body and help me heal, but I‚Äôm not waiting.I‚Äôm actively Being.And just like that, as I let go of my expectations and fully accept this moment, the magic happens.The girl doesn‚Äôt appear, but my soul is touched by something strong and I can feel the knots loosening allowing me to breathe deeper and smile wholeheartedly.It‚Äôs a precious moment, and I‚Äôm grateful to Vaclav Havel for providing me with this table in a park so I could live through it and share the tale with you.",

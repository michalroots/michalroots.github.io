Here‚Äôs the most succint solution that worked for me. Note: I had to run bundle update before and after other commands. No idea why, but it works now.To preview the website locally:  launch terminal and navigate to the folder with the site using  cd ~/PATHTOFOLDER  serve jekyll with Bundle exec jekyll serve  open http://localhost:4000 in your browserUploading Code to GithubThat was easy, because I did this before, and Github has a good manual on how to do it.  I created a new repository called &lt;username&gt;.github.io  I cloned the empty repository from Github to my computer using Github Desktop  I copied the contents of the website I have been editing on my computer to the github folder and pushed changes to Github.The website is now live at heymichal.github.io, but there are still a few things to do.Editing with ObsidianOpen the local folder with my github page as a vault in obsidian. That was super easy. I‚Äôm now editing this post in Obsidian, then commit changes and merge via Github desktop.Note that it takes some time for the changes to appear on the live site.üí° I later moved the entire local folder with my site into a /web folder inside my main obsidian vault.Setting up NetlifyThe next step is to fix tags not working at all on the site. I suppose it‚Äôs because of some incompatibility between the template I started with and Github pages. I know that the template was using Netlify to deploy the site, so I guess I‚Äôll do the same.Super easy and works like a charm.  I added a new site from git  pointed to my repository with the site on git  deployedI now have a funky netlify url: https://sleepy-mahavira-46dee4.netlify.app/ which I can change into a custom domain with SSL, which is the obvious next step.I also tested the speed of publishing and it works instantly. I edit in Obsidian, push with Github Desktop and it‚Äôs live.The only trouble is that images don‚Äôt seem to be showing at all in previews on social media (I‚Äôm using this tool and twitter card validator to test). I checked the YAML frontmatter and it all seems fine to my eye:layout: post title: The Red Caped Girl description: The magic happens when I tune into myself. image: /assets/touch-of-universe.jpg tags: [letters] and yet, I keep getting this error:og:image can't be found at the defined URLI‚Äôll troubleshoot it later.Setting up custom domainThis was quite straightforward, even if the manual from Netlify was a bit overwhelming.Set up custom domain, when you get the new DNS configuration login to your domain registrar and setup the new DNS configuration, and then wait for some time for the website to show up at the new address. It took around 2 hours in my case, and the site is now operational!üéâTroubleshooting SSL CertificateIt turns out that while the site was live, something didn‚Äôt work with the automatic SSL encryption. I went to domain settings in Netlify, clicked on ‚Äúrenew certificate‚Äù and less than a minute later it was working properly.Optimising Obsidian &lt;&gt; Github FlowFor now I‚Äôve been using a separate obsidian vault for my website, but actually, why not keep it all together?I‚Äôve created a new folder /web in my main obsidian vault and I moved the folder with website files heymichal.github.io inside.Is this Useful?Well‚Ä¶ I hope so.

While I haven‚Äôt built the cabin myself (I only helped a bit with finishing and did some interior improvements), it gives me a great starting point for creating my first home, whenever the time for it comes.A few improvements I‚Äôd consider doing with the cabin design:  Sand and varnish all the wood inside - without it there‚Äôs plenty of wood dust, which can‚Äôt be too healthy to breathe.  Invest in good doors - the doors to the cabin are not very thick and in very heavy rainfall the water comes through.  Opening windows at the top - this would add an easy way to keep the air flowing in times when opening the front doors is not a viable option.  Add a wood burning stove - this is a bit tricky, since it‚Äôs a tiny wooden house, but there must be a way to have a tiny wooden stove inside to heat the place up in winter without relying on electricity.  Consider adding insulation - I‚Äôm not 100% sure about this because it would take some precious space, but it might be worthwhile especially on cold days. It would be a big improvement to add insulation at the roof only.  Soundproofing the roof - when it rains it can get very loud inside. Insulation would do the trick.  Instal a basic water system outside - I have a bucket with the water collected from the roof, which works, but adding a tiny bit of sophistication would be great.  Keep the food out - it‚Äôs not the cabin‚Äôs fault per se (I just don‚Äôt have a good food storage around), but I‚Äôd much rather not keep my eating station inside.

I just kept getting stuck in perfecting, even if deep down I knew that it will never be perfect anyway, and that‚Äôs totally fine, too. In the end, the 2.5 months of extra time increased its final quality by 1%.SAD TROMBONE PLAYSWell‚Ä¶ Mistakes were made, and it seems that I learned something from them:WEBSITE ENTERSHere‚Äôs how it works:I publish unfinished stuff, but I publish it consistently. And since everything is written and managed directly inside my Obsidian vault, which is the central point of my digital focus, I can update anything I publish effortlessly, at any time, on my laptop or phone. I press Alt+Tab, write a letter ‚Äúg‚Äù (for GitHub Desktop to appear as the first result) and press enter. Then click ‚Äúcommit to main‚Äù and finalise the process by clicking ‚Äúpush origin‚Äù. Robots do their work, and the website is updated.It takes me approximately 2 seconds.I keep seeing all my files on the left. Folder structure includes (among other things) three web projects (my personal website, journalsmarter and microsolidarity in pico), each with /assets folder containing images. I can manipulate all files, restructure websites, move files from one project to another, link in between etc, and then in 2 seconds all changes are published.This is the first part of my strategy, which is complimented by the fact that not many people read my personal website (or at least I assume so, and I have no data to check, because the site has no tracking of any sort, which is a deliberate decision because I find tracking on the internet quite creepy. But I digress). Not many readers = not much pressure, in fact it‚Äôs probably just me and you right now who have ever visited this page.No resistance to publish + no pressure to publish is a combo that really does it for me.Here‚Äôs my current example:I was editing a poem which I wrote during a sailing trip which begun the transition into the chapter of my life that has just concluded as I write these words right now (okay, not exactly, but the actual day of the new beginning is only a couple of days off, which makes me smile feeling into the magical world of synchronicities).As I was editing the poem, an idea bounced into my mind: to start writing a meta article about my writing workflow, because it feels like a useful gift I could offer to someone who‚Äôd like to make writing a self-inflicted addiction.That‚Äôs kinda what happened to me.I struggled to build a digital publishing habit, so I turned it into addiction.( I can feel my certified habit coach part giving me a shoulder pat as I type these words, btw. )I clicked Ctrl+N, abandoned the poem for a while (we‚Äôll come back to it later), and begun writing a new note with a raw title How I Use My Personal Website.I furiously typed the next 598 words. Breath. 600.Then took this screenshot:(There will be a few more in this article - I‚Äôve been taking them occasionally since I want to show how I do it, instead of just telling the story.)If I‚Äôd like to publish it right now, I‚Äôd rename the name of the note by clicking on it - so it can be formatted for publishing. I‚Äôd call it:2022-04-18-personal-website-flowWhich would make me consider the title of this article. In the past I‚Äôd obsess about finding a perfect title, but now I‚Äôd just leave it as it is, noticing my recovering perfectionist part closing its eyes with horror!üôàThe part would get absolutely terrified, as it would begin following the note with this article being moved into the folder containing my published website./web/heymichal.github.io/_postsAt this point I actually went through the steps I just outlined, which brought the third look at the title of this article, which resulted in a decision to call it:Personal Website Flow - How I Use This WebsiteNot perfect, but good enough for now and safe enough to try.I‚Äôve copy-pasted the front matter from another post (I could have inserted it from template to make it faster), which forced me to add a description and relevant tags.And just like that this note is ready to publish.21üöÄIt‚Äôs live.Please note that it‚Äôs imperfect as fuck.I mean there is a paragraph typed below that I wrote before and decided not to include, but felt bad to delete it because it feels like a good paragraph to come back to at some point. Moreover, there are no screenshots included, and the links are all missing.Definitely suboptimal.But here‚Äôs the most important thing:I just published a 911 words article in 20 minutes or so. That‚Äôs a second thing I published today.Hey, I might tweet it, just for the laughs. I feel like it‚Äôs something that Rob would appreciate.As I get ready to copy the link so I can place it into the tweet, I start reading the published article. Perfect - I‚Äôll catch some basic spelling mistakes and small shit like that. I won‚Äôt bother with deep proof reading, images or links.‚è≥Proofreading is now complete, which means I can cmd+Tab to GitHub Desktop and commit.That is all, folks.Funny enough, I decide not to take this final step right now, because I notice that lonely paragraph again, and on an impulse decide to make it an integral part of this article, rather than leaving a few random lines at the end of the article completely out of context.

It turned out that I‚Äôd find a Person I would spend 8 years together with, and eventually move to Portugal, where I‚Äôm living now (although it‚Äôs not the continental part of Portugal).Okay, tangent finished. It‚Äôs still random.

Considering that my last few weeks are basically non-stop action from morning to late at night, it seems like now is a good moment to pause and ask myself gently:WTF ARE YOU DOING, MICHA≈Å?Checking in to my Enspiral Work Pod was a perfect opportunity to reflect on that question. Here‚Äôs what came up:  I know very well that this is not sustainable modus operandi and I know that in the next week I will make an effort to increase the amount of free space in my day. On the other hand, I‚Äôve noticed that in order to keep up with all the open projects I‚Äôm fuelling my energy into at the moment, I needed to step up my personal productivity game, and drop some projects that I just couldn‚Äôt keep up with anymore.In other words, the times of nakurw {roughly translated as ‚Äúfull fucking thrust‚Äù} forced me to cut the crap and develop a super effective way of juggling all my things to do without even noticing.After all I am a juggler.ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èLet‚Äôs geek out on this for a bit, shall we?1. Braindump into ObsidianWhen in doubt - Braindump ‚úÖObsidian is the central point of my digital focus. I write everything there and continuously optimise it for effortlessness.So: I created a note called Braindump ‚úÖ and started dumping all the shit I want to do there.It‚Äôs kinda like a backlog, but I don‚Äôt need another app for it.I progressively edit the list every time I look at it, which is kinda all the time, and rearrange the order of items in order of priority. Whenever I notice resistance suggesting that a task is too big to execute, or not clear enough, I replace it with a smaller version of that task, or define it better.I also added some basic guidance on top:In this example ‚Äútax return‚Äù is way too big, and I replaced with a single step from my accounting checklist.Whenever I complete a task, I move it to the  done ‚úÖ section below all the tasks and feel the boost of endorfins kicking in.2. Timebox in Proton CalendarI timebox almost everything into my calendar, including meetings and work slots.For work slots, I write specific tasks I intend on executing.During the day I just follow the plan and dynamically adjust calendar events as needed. Whenever a task is done, I mark it as ‚úÖ.3. Reply ImmediatelyI use the octopus of my digital communication channels (Signal, Telegram, Whatsapp, Email, Slack, Discord‚Ä¶) to dynamically brainstorm, schedule, and move tasks forward.When working with others, I aim to reply as soon as possible in order to leave the ball at their side. This way I don‚Äôt need to remember to do something - it eventually comes back to me whenever the other person is ready to bounce it back. Most people take their sweet time to reply, which is perfect because it gives me time for other tasks.Of course, this is not a perfect system and I‚Äôm not perfect either, duh.Sometimes I take much longer to reply, or forget to follow up on something. In any case, it works most of the times, and if a task is mission critical, it is recorded somewhere else, so I won‚Äôt forget about it completely. Worst case scenario it will take me longer to get around to it.OK Computer, that‚Äôs it for the digital stuff.üíªLet‚Äôs zoom out for a bit into the good, old organic world.(twitter thread about my digital and analogue workspace.)4.

            "content_text": "Context: This article is deliberately unfinished to illustrate a point. It will all make sense, I promise. I also created a full version here.üê¶My personal website is pretty much targeted for me - so I can publish as much as possible.The fact that it‚Äôs live online, adds some pressure on the quality of what I publish, but more importantly helps me overcome my perfectionistic tendencies. For context, it took me 3 months to write [this article]. It was worth it, but I could have done it in 2 weeks. I just kept getting stuck in perfecting, even if deep down I knew that it will never be perfect anyway, and that‚Äôs totally fine, too. In the end, the 2.5 months of extra time increased it‚Äôs final quality by 1%.SAD TROMBONE PLAYSWell‚Ä¶ Mistakes were made, and it seems that I learned something from them:WEBSITE ENTERSHere‚Äôs how it works:I publish unfinished stuff, but I publish it consistently. And since [everything is written and managed directly inside my Obsidian vault], which is the central point of my digital [focus], I can update anything I publish effortlessly, at any time, on my laptop or phone. I press Alt+Tab, write a letter ‚Äúg‚Äù (for GitHub Desktop to appear as the first result) and press enter. Then click ‚Äúcommit to main‚Äù and finalise the process by clicking ‚Äúpush origin‚Äù. Robots do their work, and the website is updated.It takes me approximately 2 seconds.I keep seeing all my files on the left. Folder structure includes (among other things) three web projects (my personal website, [journalsmarter] and [microsolidarity in pico]), each with /assets folder containing images. I can manipulate all files, restructure websites, move files from one project to another, link in between etc, and then in 2 seconds all changes are published.This is the first part of my strategy, which is complimented by the fact that not many people read my personal website (or at least I assume so, and I have no data to check, because the site has no tracking of any sort, which is a deliberate decision because I find tracking on the internet quite creepy. But I digress). Not many readers = not much pressure, in fact it‚Äôs probably just me and you right now who have ever visited this page.No resistance to publish + no pressure to publish is a combo that really does it for me.Here‚Äôs my current example:I was editing a [poem] which I wrote during a sailing trip which begun the transition into the chapter of my life that has just concluded as I write these words right now (okay, not exactly, but the actual day of the new beginning is only a couple of days off, which makes me smile feeling into the magical world of synchronicities).As I was editing the poem, an idea bounced into my mind: to start writing a meta article about my writing workflow, because it feels like a useful gift I could offer to someone who‚Äôd like to make writing a self-inflicted addiction.That‚Äôs kinda what happened to me.I struggled to build a digital publishing habit, so I turned it into addiction.( I can feel my [certified habit coach part] giving me a shoulder pat as I type these words, btw. )I clicked Ctrl+N, abandoned the poem for a while (we‚Äôll come back to it later), and begun writing a new note with a raw title How I Use My Personal Website.I furiously typed the next 598 words. Breath. 600.Then took this screenshot:IMG(There will be a few more in this article - I‚Äôve been taking them occasionally since I want to show how I do it, instead of just telling the story.)If I‚Äôd like to publish it right now, I‚Äôd rename the name of the note by clicking on it - so it can be formatted for publishing. I‚Äôd call it:2022-04-18-personal-website-flowWhich would make me consider the title of this article. In the past I‚Äôd obsess about finding a perfect title, but now I‚Äôd just leave it as it is, noticing my recovering perfectionist part closing its eyes with horror!üôàThe part would get absolutely terrified, as it would begin following the note with this article being moved into the folder containing my published website./web/heymichal.github.io/_postsAt this point I actually went through the steps I just outlined, which brought the third look at the title of this article, which resulted in a decision to call it:Personal Website Flow - How I Use This WebsiteNot perfect, but good enough for now and safe enough to try.I‚Äôve copy-pasted the front matter from another post (I could have inserted it from template to make it faster), which forced me to add a description and relevant tags.IMGAnd just like that this note is ready to publish.21üöÄIt‚Äôs live.IMGPlease note that it‚Äôs imperfect as fuck.I mean there is a paragraph typed below that I wrote before and decided not to include, but felt bad to delete it because it feels like a good paragraph to come back to at some point. Moreover, there are no screenshots included, and the links are all missing.Definitely suboptimal.But here‚Äôs the most important thing:I just published a 911 words article in 20 minutes or so. That‚Äôs a second thing I published today.Hey, I might tweet it, just for the laughs. I feel like it‚Äôs something that [Rob] would appreciate.As I get ready to copy the link so I can place it into the tweet, I start reading the published article. Perfect - I‚Äôll catch some basic spelling mistakes and small shit like that. I won‚Äôt bother with deep proof reading, images or links.‚è≥Proofreading is now complete, which means I can cmd+Tab to GitHub Desktop and commit.That is all, folks.Funny enough, I decide not to take this final step right now, because I notice that lonely paragraph again, and on an impulse decide to make it an integral part of this article, rather than leaving a few random lines at the end of the article completely out of context. I guess that‚Äôs fair to you..To give context, we need to return to the poem.I was editing it so I can get it ready for a spoken word collaboration with [Jo√£o Moreira] - one of the two Portuguese men whom I connected with deeply many years back in Albania, and on my return to Edinburgh which was my home at the time, I immediately booked my tickets to Portugal to fly there 2 months later. It turned out that I‚Äôd find a Person I would spend 8 years together with, and eventually move to Portugal, where I‚Äôm living now (although it‚Äôs not the continental part of Portugal).Okay, tangent finished. It‚Äôs still random. Forgive me.In any case, the poem is still awaiting editing, which is actually perfect, because I feel like my work here is done for now.I just need two clicks to republish this article, send the link to Rob, and then come back to what I was doing, before a sudden breeze of air would bring me here together with you.BIRDS SURFING OCEAN WIND VIDEOI used to be a turtle.Now I am a bird.üê¶ps.

I press Alt+Tab, write a letter ‚Äúg‚Äù (for GitHub Desktop to appear as the first result) and press enter. Then click ‚Äúcommit to main‚Äù and finalise the process by clicking ‚Äúpush origin‚Äù. Robots do their work, and the website is updated.</p><p>It takes me approximately 2 seconds.</p><p>I keep seeing all my files on the left. Folder structure includes (among other things) three web projects (my personal website, [journalsmarter] and [microsolidarity in pico]), each with /assets folder containing images. I can manipulate all files, restructure websites, move files from one project to another, link in between etc, and then in 2 seconds all changes are published.</p><p>This is the first part of my strategy, which is complimented by the fact that not many people read my personal website (or at least I assume so, and I have no data to check, because the site has no tracking of any sort, which is a deliberate decision because I find tracking on the internet quite creepy. But I digress). Not many readers = not much pressure, in fact it‚Äôs probably just me and you right now who have ever visited this page.</p><p>No resistance to publish + no pressure to publish is a combo that really does it for me.</p><p>Here‚Äôs my current example:</p><p>I was editing a [poem] which I wrote during a sailing trip which begun the transition into the chapter of my life that has just concluded as I write these words right now (okay, not exactly, but the actual day of the new beginning is only a couple of days off, which makes me smile feeling into the magical world of synchronicities).</p><p>As I was editing the poem, an idea bounced into my mind: to start writing a meta article about my writing workflow, because it feels like a useful gift I could offer to someone who‚Äôd like to make writing a self-inflicted addiction.</p><p>That‚Äôs kinda what happened to me.</p><p><strong>I struggled to build a digital publishing habit, so I turned it into addiction.</strong></p><p>( I can feel my [certified habit coach part] giving me a shoulder pat as I type these words, btw. )</p><p>I clicked Ctrl+N, abandoned the poem for a while (we‚Äôll come back to it later), and begun writing a new note with a raw title How I Use My Personal Website.</p><p>I furiously typed the next 598 words. Breath. 600.</p><p>Then took this screenshot:</p><p>IMG</p><p>(There will be a few more in this article - I‚Äôve been taking them occasionally since I want to show how I do it, instead of just telling the story.)</p><p>If I‚Äôd like to publish it right now, I‚Äôd rename the name of the note by clicking on it - so it can be formatted for publishing. I‚Äôd call it:</p><pre><code>2022-04-18-personal-website-flow</code></pre><p>Which would make me consider the title of this article. In the past I‚Äôd obsess about finding a perfect title, but now I‚Äôd just leave it as it is, noticing my recovering perfectionist part closing its eyes with horror!</p><p>üôà</p><p>The part would get absolutely terrified, as it would begin following the note with this article being moved into the folder containing my published website.</p><pre><code>/web/heymichal.github.io/_posts</code></pre><p>At this point I actually went through the steps I just outlined, which brought the third look at the title of this article, which resulted in a decision to call it:</p><pre><code>Personal Website Flow - How I Use This Website</code></pre><p>Not perfect, but good enough for now and safe enough to try.</p><p>I‚Äôve copy-pasted the front matter from another post (I could have inserted it from template to make it faster), which forced me to add a description and relevant tags.</p><p>IMG</p><p>And just like that this note is ready to publish.</p><p>2</p><p>1</p><p>üöÄ</p><p>It‚Äôs live.</p><p>IMG</p><p>Please note that it‚Äôs imperfect as fuck.</p><p>I mean there is a paragraph typed below that I wrote before and decided not to include, but felt bad to delete it because it feels like a good paragraph to come back to at some point. Moreover, there are no screenshots included, and the links are all missing.</p><p>Definitely suboptimal.</p><p>But here‚Äôs the most important thing:</p><p>I just published a 911 words article in 20 minutes or so. That‚Äôs a second thing I published today.</p><p>Hey, I might tweet it, just for the laughs. I feel like it‚Äôs something that [Rob] would appreciate.</p><p>As I get ready to copy the link so I can place it into the tweet, I start reading the published article. Perfect - I‚Äôll catch some basic spelling mistakes and small shit like that. I won‚Äôt bother with deep proof reading, images or links.</p><p>‚è≥</p><p>Proofreading is now complete, which means I can cmd+Tab to GitHub Desktop and commit.</p><p>That is all, folks.</p><p>Funny enough, I decide not to take this final step right now, because I notice that lonely paragraph again, and on an impulse decide to make it an integral part of this article, rather than leaving a few random lines at the end of the article completely out of context. I guess that‚Äôs fair to you..</p><p>To give context, we need to return to the poem.</p><p>I was editing it so I can get it ready for a spoken word collaboration with [Jo√£o Moreira] - one of the two Portuguese men whom I connected with deeply many years back in Albania, and on my return to Edinburgh which was my home at the time, I immediately booked my tickets to Portugal to fly there 2 months later. It turned out that I‚Äôd find a Person I would spend 8 years together with, and eventually move to Portugal, where I‚Äôm living now (although it‚Äôs not the continental part of Portugal).</p><p>Okay, tangent finished. It‚Äôs still random. Forgive me.</p><p>In any case, the poem is still awaiting editing, which is actually perfect, because I feel like my work here is done for now.</p><p>I just need two clicks to republish this article, send the link to Rob, and then come back to what I was doing, before a sudden breeze of air would bring me here together with you.</p><pre><code>BIRDS SURFING OCEAN WIND VIDEO</code></pre><p>I used to be a turtle.</p><p>Now I am a bird.</p><p>üê¶</p><p>ps. Next time we meet in person, feel free to ask me to greet you with the wonderfully strange bird call from the island located not too far from the Atlantis. I have a feeling you will love it.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1516193384037502984?s=20&amp;t=EoUU6kttWTMCyMREqxUf4A\">tweet proof</a>.</p>",

And the reality connected with the number thirty three seems definitely like something I‚Äôd like to aim to manifest in the coming years.A little confession:I‚Äôve been having a hard time recently.I guess it‚Äôs the proximity of another birthday that makes me consider existential questions such as what do I have to show for myself and what is my contribution to the world. It makes me think of the Funeral Exercise: what would be the speeches on your funeral like?.I guess there is an egoistic tendency here to ‚Äúbe special‚Äù, ‚Äúmake an impact‚Äù and simply ‚Äúmatter‚Äù, but I find that it‚Äôs also a useful lens to look at ones life, and brutally strip it off from all the mundane bullshit that doesn‚Äôt really matter.Anyway.Truth is, I‚Äôve had quite a difficult time while taking a long hard honest look at myself. I like to think of myself as a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù, whatever that means, and I do have a deep underlying sense that everything is unfolding perfectly, including this trying moment of meticulous self-assessment.In the same time I notice things that feel hard to admit.I feel angry.I feel impatient.I find it easy to start something, but hard to maintain it.I‚Äôm also noticing a big tension around the subject of money. Fuck, that‚Äôs actually a big one. Somehow, I find an expense of ‚Ç¨300 to visit my parents and sister after two and half years a significant hole in my personal budget and I need to carefully juggle my finances to make it happen. WTF.I live cheaply. I don‚Äôt need much. And yet, somehow I can‚Äôt seem to unlock access to the infinite financial abundance that the world has to offer, despite trying for years. It‚Äôs frustrating and it adds up to the feeling of anger. Perhaps the worst part is that I know that it‚Äôs all within myself and I can indeed shift it at any point. I just never managed to do it.Now, I‚Äôm not complaining by any means, and I do feel immensely grateful for what I have.In fact, I‚Äôve been gifted a beautiful lifestyle in an idyllic place, surrounded by people who I get to call my Island Family. That definitely counts for A LOT and it‚Äôs more than many people could ever wish for. It seems worth much more than a few zeros of net worth. And yet, a part of me can‚Äôt relax.So I lay down on the floor of my 3x3 wooden cabin in a beautiful forest with an ocean view, the most amazing house I‚Äôve ever lived in, and sink down into myself.Why am I feeling agitated? What is it inside of me that is not in alignment? Why am I feeling so disconnected in the last few weeks?My cat-mate Kiki sleeps on my chest. I can feel her weight as I inhale and exhale. The binaural beats relax me. I let go of the tension and accept myself with all the perceived imperfections. I notice them in a different light, too.My vices are inseparably interwoven with my virtues and vice versa.The anger is an imbalance of inextinguishable life force, allowing me to not be afraid to make difficult choices and stick with them.The impatience derives from wanting to manifest dreams.The difficulty to maintain connects with seeing potential in everything, which fuels my tendency to naturally help people with whatever struggle they go through.What a convoluted mess of self.There‚Äôs more, but I won‚Äôt elaborate further.The bottom line is that as my birthday approaches it‚Äôs time to make some tough decisions. I can‚Äôt do everything. I don‚Äôt want to do everything. I don‚Äôt always know what I want, or to be more precise - I intuitively feel what is my path, but sometimes I disconnect from myself by staying way too much in my head.I notice that my mind is precisely where the money messes me up.The second I consider questions like ‚Äúhow does this idea bring money‚Äù or ‚Äúhow do I support myself financially‚Äù, I close, disconnect and get stuck again. My mind starts spinning, and combined with the tendency to overthink, it happily goes forever, bringing me overwhelm, with enough glimpse of possibility to keep luring me deeper into this trap.Argh.How to leave it behind?I wish I‚Äôd know.The thing is, I do know, I just don‚Äôt have access to it. Not yet.Or‚Ä¶?As I dance underneath the starlit sky above the deck of my cabin, I shake off the doubts and bring in new energy.A new cycle of my life is afoot.It‚Äôs up to me to make it whatever I want it to be.And I do.",

I feel like everything that happened this year was a long process of integrating everything that happened in my life so far, and preparing me for something new.Here‚Äôs the drawing of my year:I‚Äôll share with you a bit more about it, using a few scans from the pages of my 2021 journals, captured during my yearly review.Enjoy üíúYear of SquaresThe year begins with the Squares of course.You‚Äôll notice that they changed quite significantly through the year. This is the page that took me from 15 Nov 2020 to 12 Jan 2021.Squares were a major theme of the year. I finally figured out what they are really about, and what is the most effective and fun way for me to inspire others to play along. In September I finally transformed the unpronounceable Minimalist Journaling System into Infinity Squares, and launched a brand new email-based course.As you can see below, my squares evolved a lot. Here‚Äôs September 2021:And in case you‚Äôre wondering, I still haven‚Äôt skipped a single one in over 1400 days. It is the most fundamental self-alignment practice in my life.On the other hand, I also realised that I need to make space in my professional life. I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of confusion around JournalSmarter, which led to writing a letter to it (as in to the brand itself), where I tried to inquire what does JS want to become. After a long and painful process, I‚Äôve decided to radically simplify my entire approach and launched (today) a new website. JournalSmarter will no longer be my main professional focus, in order to make space for what I feel called to do (more on that later). I‚Äôll still keep the courses going and add a new journaling game / course whenever I feel like it. I also have a few pieces of the journaling puzzle that are ready to be published, so I‚Äôll make than happen in the next few days. And then it‚Äôs time to breathe.Paradoxically, by removing all the financial pressure from JournalSmarter, as well as radically simplifying how it works, I have a feeling that this project will be more successful than ever. And I admit that the moment of insight which lead me to describe journaling as an infinite game unlocked something that has been stuck for a long time.Welcome to JournalSmarter 3.0. I hope that it will bring you a lot of joy.üìñ‚ú®Year of PracticeIn December 2019 I had this crazy idea to offer a year-long cohort-based course, where I‚Äôll take 20 people on a journey of building 3 practices of their choice through the year.I‚Äôm still due to write an in-depth documentation article on that journey, so I won‚Äôt go into more details now, and instead I‚Äôll share about my own practices. Funny enough, they were completely different from what I expected them to be.BeingIn the summer I felt a call to ditch the comforts of a house and moved into a forest. It has been the most impactful summer of my life, along with 2013 (when I hitchhiked from Scotland to Greece) and 2017 (when I said goodbye to Edinburgh and began location independent life).Photo by Austƒója Liup≈°eviƒçi≈´tƒóBeing in the forest started a deep process of reconnection with myself, tuning into my intuition, which allowed me to rediscover what is important to me and how I want to manifest it. I am forever grateful to Jean-Daniel who allowed me to live on his land, as well as Austeja and Niko, who were my forest neighbours.My home in the Magical ForestI started to write poetry and letters again, I felt free like I haven‚Äôt in a couple of years, and I have learnt a few critical lessons, which I then integrated on a trip to the Mainland Portugal in September, which blew my mind beyond anything I knew before.WalkingThe seed of walking has been planted during my little camino in Faial island. I felt called to go there and connect with the island, and instead of cycling or driving I wanted to walk. So I walked for three days pretty much non-stop, covering the entire island, climbing up and down volcanoes, and sleeping in a hammock in the forest.In September, I spent three weeks walking in Lisbon and Porto, for most of my waking hours. Soon after walking up I‚Äôd leave the house and began walking, walking, walking only to come back late at night to sleep and then walk again the following day.I have never reached such a deep level of self-awareness until that trip. I‚Äôve experienced unprecedented abundance, flow of synchronicities, moments of beauty, unexpected beautiful connections with people and other beings, and powerful insights. It changed me.I don‚Äôt really have words to describe it just yet.I wrote ‚ÄúI want to‚Äù and then decided to strike it through, as ‚ÄúI am‚Äù walking and writing stories. It is happening already. And if you‚Äôre curious about what was the story written below, it is here and it was a moment of vulnerable and hilarious insight.In 2021, walking became my meditation. My way of Being. My lifestyle.It‚Äôs all I need in order to encounter and create Magic. And Magic is precisely what I‚Äôm after.Making SpaceCreating spaces for magic to emerge is something that I feel called for, and it‚Äôs also when I feel like fish in the sea.This year was special in that regard.I co-hosted the first community gathering in Pico, which was a game-changer for the community. Before the gathering I used to feel that I have friends in the island. After the gathering I had a family.I took this energy further with our second gathering, designed to 1) help each of us to understand what kind of community do we want to be a part of, and 2) find ways to support each other to make these visions come true in the context of our island. It was a very special moment for our community and for me, as a catalyst. Here‚Äôs a community catalysing game I prototyped during the gathering.I still remember the crazy brainstorming session when the game idea came to me:My wonderful island family gave life to the prototype and created a map full of exciting projects.I‚Äôve also created a performance with Austeja, which moved local people and kids in ways that we haven‚Äôt expected. We also co-created a more events in Pico, such as Slam Jam, Masking Around, and more. We also had our bi-weekly sharing circle and a drum crew. Loads and Loads of spaces and even more magical moments that emerged from there.I‚Äôve also had the honour to create a wedding ceremony for a dear friend and his lovely partner. I loved it and I‚Äôm game for creating more ceremonies. Call me üòâ.Apart from making spaces in real life, I‚Äôve also created some powerful digital experiences, such as Year of Practice (a year-long practice-building community), Habit Sprint (a three-month, focused version), Relational Weekly Review (a weekly co-journaling session boosted with relational growth), *Enspiral Europe Connection Weekend (an experiment in weaving social fabric in the European part of Enspiral network) and more.Intermission: Top Songs, Films, and Books of 2021.Three Songs That Moved MeAdult Jazz - Springfulbandcamp | spotifyAs I was about to depart for a trip that would turn out to be the most powerful journey in my life so far, I asked my best friend for a gift: a few songs to go along with me. Springful was the one that created a powerful emotional shift inside of me, and prompted me to dance, dance, dance and then dance some more, as I was deepening my self-awareness reaching unprecedented levels, while walking for hours in the streets of Lisbon and Porto.It is one of these few songs that will always stay with me, reminding me of this very special moment in my personal history whenever I get to listen to it.Milo - Folk Metaphysics soundcloud | spotify lyricsI remember the moment when this song came into my headphones for the first time. I paused. I listen to it, and then listened to it on repeat a few times to really understand the lyrics. There‚Äôs something about this song that puts me in a very special state of Being  ‚Äì¬†humble, honest, creative, melancholic, connected.Milo is one of the most important poets I discovered this year, and I highly recommend his work.Climbing Poetree - Awakeningbancamp| spotify lyricsSpeaking of poets, here‚Äôs two of them, united in a raw and powerful force of nature poetry. Listening to this song (and a few other ones) make me shiver, and there are not many songs that can do that.Note:I deliberately avoided youtube links for the songs, as I‚Äôm on a quest to set myself free from google. It‚Äôs not an easy task and it requires practice.Three Films that I absolutely lovedThe Twentieth Century MubiIncredible example of neo-German-expressionism, depicting the story of a Canadian prime minister rising to power. The vibe is really quite something, and it‚Äôs good old-school set design, not computer generated stuff.The Brick WikipediaDear, oh dear, what a feast.The dialogue, the characters, the intrigue, the cinematography‚Ä¶ I loved all of it. And translating the tropes of noir into American high-school environment works exceptionally well. Make no mistake ‚Äì this is nothing like a typical American high-school comedy. Brick is a piece of art.One of my favourite moments is the conversation when the hero rejects help from la famme:  BRENDANLook, I can‚Äôt trust you. You ought to be smart enough to know that. I didn‚Äôt shake up the party to get your attention, and I‚Äôm not heeling you to hook you. Your connections could help me, but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me. Better off coming at it clean.  LAURAI wouldn‚Äôt have to lead you in by the‚Ä¶  BRENDANI can‚Äôt trust you. Brad was a sap, you weren‚Äôt. You‚Äôre with him, so you‚Äôre playing him. So you‚Äôre a player. With you behind me, I‚Äôd have to tie one eye up, watching both of your hands. I can‚Äôt spare it.You‚Äôre absolutely right, Brendan. She is a player indeed.Another Round MubiFour school teachers embark on an experiment to prove an obscure theory: maintain a constant level of alcohol to see if it will make them happy. The result is a wonderfully dark comedy from the magnificent Scandinavian school of film-making.Speaking of good films, I can‚Äôt recommend MUBI enough. The curation is amazing, and instead of force-feeding whatever into your throat like Netflix, Mubi actually helps you find cinematic gems. This link gets you (and me) a free month.Honorable mention: A Gathering of the TribeA powerful, 9 minute short, perfectly fitting for our current times. It really touched me.Youtube linkBook of the YearSacred Economics by Charles Eisenstein. No doubt here.In fact, I find Charles to be one of the most important writers of today‚Äôs world. I can‚Äôt recommend checking out his work on Substack. Here‚Äôs one of the recent essays that expressed very accurately a lot of my feelings regarding that virus: A Path Will Rise to Meet Us.The Alternative Culture is here. All we need to do is shine ‚ú®Most of all, the 2021 shown me that the (for a lack of better word) global capitalist culture is not only complete bullshit (this I knew for a long time), but the alternative is already here and so many people already made the shift. It‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs happening. No more excuses and keeping the hamster wheel going.It‚Äôs been such a privilege to learn from and with all the wonderful souls I‚Äôve met this year. Here are a few of them along with ideas they shared with me:It‚Äôs not that the change is coming.It is right here, right now.All we need to do is shine ‚ú®.And, of course, NO FEAR.Fear is the heart killer.Gratitude MandalaSpeaking of the people I‚Äôve been lucky to connect with‚Ä¶Every year I draw a Gratitude Mandala, which includes beings I‚Äôm grateful for in the year that has ended. It‚Äôs a part of my yearly review since 2019.Here‚Äôs my mandala for 2021:Since I‚Äôve been reconnecting with my letter writing practice recently, I‚Äôve decided to write as many letters to as many of these wonderful souls as possible. Some of the letters will be public, and I‚Äôll keep adding them here.For now, there‚Äôs only a letter to Kiki, the wonderful cat that lives with me, which is an absolutely amazing being, and I‚Äôve learn a lot from her.And hey, since you are here right now:THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF MY LIFE.üíú üíú üíúSetting a new course for 2022New Lunar Year is a good moment to adjust the course I‚Äôm taking in life.I still feel like doing a bit more internal soul-searching in that field, but the direction is clear.My #1 priority in 2022 is to create and document regenerative communities.It seems like it‚Äôs a perfect Ikigai ‚Äì a direction encompassing something the world needs, something I‚Äôm good at, something I love doing and something I can get paid for. I wrote a sweet article about Ikigai a long time ago, and I actually feel like revisiting the exercises I shared there.But for now, here‚Äôs a hypothesis:If I make more space for my community catalysing activities and keep documenting what I do and how I do it (whether in Pico, the Azores, Enspiral or in digital spaces) my work will create a serious ripple effect inspiring and encouraging people to create their own communities and regenerative projects. And part of that ripple effect will come back to me in the form of gratitude and financial support allowing me to do more meaningful work in that area.In other words, instead of pushing to sell products, I‚Äôd rather be supported by people who believe that what I do is important, and who want to help me make it happen. So, I‚Äôve set up a Patreon account and I‚Äôm curious to see if it‚Äôs a viable path for me right now. It‚Äôd mean the world to me if you would consider being a part of that journey.You can see what I‚Äôm focusing on here.I wish you Freedom, Joy and Fulfilment. Let‚Äôs co-create a beautiful world where all beings can thrive. It‚Äôs possible. All we need to do is shine ‚ú®.Thank you for Being,Micha≈Çps. Since this is a New Moon, I‚Äôd like to share my Moonly video (a practice I reconnected with this summer and kept it going without skipping a beat until now). Here it is (youtube link, since I still haven‚Äôt made my mind as to where to upload videos instead of google‚Ä¶ TBC). If you want to see more, here‚Äôs the entire collection. And speaking of that - it‚Äôs such a wonderful way of going back through my year. I‚Äôm so grateful for this practice!pps. As I went through all the one-second-a-day videos from this year I‚Äôve noticed one HUGE thing missing from my yearly review - sailing with Maria Armanda, a traditional whaling boat. I‚Äôm so grateful to Amanda who brought Marcos into my life, who connected me with Felipe, who took me as a crew. I need sailing in my life. It‚Äôs essential ‚õµÔ∏è.",

It‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs happening.</strong> No more excuses and keeping the hamster wheel going.</p><p>It‚Äôs been such a privilege to learn from and with all the wonderful souls I‚Äôve met this year.

I wrote a <a href=\"https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-chart-a-new-course-for-your-life-with-3-simple-diagrams-e9cc6b59c49d?sk=9afa2b3f5abcec0c48774bf022b1ef77\" target=\"_blank\">sweet article</a> about Ikigai a long time ago, and I actually feel like revisiting the exercises I shared there.</p><p>But for now, here‚Äôs a hypothesis:</p><p><strong>If I make more space for my community catalysing activities and keep documenting what I do and how I do it (whether in <a href=\"https://pico.microsolidarity.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Pico</a>, the Azores, <a href=\"https://enspiral.com\" target=\"_blank\">Enspiral</a> or in digital spaces) my work will create a serious ripple effect inspiring and encouraging people to create their own communities and regenerative projects. And part of that ripple effect will come back to me in the form of gratitude and financial support allowing me to do more meaningful work in that area.</strong></p><p>In other words, instead of pushing to sell products, I‚Äôd rather be supported by people who believe that what I do is important, and who want to help me make it happen. So, I‚Äôve set up a <a href=\"https://patreon.com/michalkorzonek\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon account</a> and I‚Äôm curious to see if it‚Äôs a viable path for me right now. It‚Äôd mean the world to me if you would consider being a part of that journey.</p><p>You can see what I‚Äôm focusing on <a href=\"/focus\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><hr /><p>I wish you Freedom, Joy and Fulfilment.

Over numerous year of interacting with the internet, I have conditioned myself to default to google, and it‚Äôs not easy at all to give it up.This is a powerful realisation, because I am a certified habit building coach, and I have worked with clients (and myself) in the area of habit building for quite some time. This means I know exactly how to approach this situation effectively, or at least give it my best shot.The critical idea in habit-building is to steadily keep moving forward with a tiny habit, rather than overcommitting. This is why I don‚Äôt intend to migrate away from google in a week or so, but rather see it as an ongoing process, which I‚Äôm going to document here.Here‚Äôs my (ongoing) process:‚úÖGoogle ChromeI always preferred Firefox. Brave is cool too (I use it on mobile). Easy peasy.Google SearchMojeek + DuckDuckGoI swapped to DuckDuckGo years ago and it used to be my default search engine until I read this amazing article exploring private search engines. Turns out DDG stores some information, plus it is US-based, which doesn‚Äôt inspire my confidence at all.I‚Äôve decided to move to Mojeek as my primary search, and supplement it with DDG whenever necessary.Youtube for musicSpotifyI‚Äôve quit youtube for music when I joined Spotify. I have a family premium account. Other alternatives I like are Soundcloud and Bandcamp . The latter is a great way of supporting artists I love financially and downloading music for offline use, which will come in handy when I move to a sailboat ‚õµÔ∏è.‚è≥Google DriveCryptdriveI love cryptdrive and it was a no-brainer to switch. I‚Äôm using it for all new files, but I still need to migrate documents from Google Drive.Unfortunately, this is one of these things that have a tendency of sending me down a rabbit hole of over organising folders etc. I admit my drive is a combination of well organised PARA system and a folder with all the mess that I made over the years, which I never got to really clean up.It‚Äôs worth noting here that I‚Äôm redesigning my computer experience for offline-first and obsidian-centered.GmailProtonmailAfter going on a rabbit hole of research triggered by this article  about secure emails, I reached a conclusion that there is no fully private option on the market. Even Protonmail and Tutanota have serious issues.After considering different pros and cons, I made my decision to go with protonmail. It‚Äôs not perfect, but definitely better than gmail.Unfortunately, this is where the migration becomes tricky.1) All my digital world relies on multiple @gmail addresses and the process of moving to Proton is essentially an opportunity to practice one of the virtues I‚Äôm not so good at ‚Äì patience.2) My recovering-perfectionist mind wants me to create a perfect combination of email addresses, for personal, work and secret purposes.The habit-building work begins here. I created my free protonmail account and started using it for creating new accounts, subscriptions etc. I‚Äôll eventually move to a paid plan, as I ditch my business google accounts.Google CalendarProton CalendarThere are three problems with Proton Calendar:  the design on mobile is quite poor for my use case, and since I have to use the dedicated app I can‚Äôt fix it with a third-party app  development cycles in Proton are ridiculously long.  can it work with calendly or other scheduling tool?For now I started migrating some of my events there, and I‚Äôll continue the process over time.Youtube‚ö†Ô∏è research phase: D.tube and OdyseeI just caught myself automatically going to youtube to look for something (LYT obsidian videos), which yet again brings me back to the idea that quitting Google is like quitting a bad habit.I noticed though, so I went on to try alternatives.

I admit that I‚Äôd love to experience a day as your shadow once, to see what you are doing when you‚Äôre in the forest. Who knows, maybe one day I‚Äôll have a chance. In fact, it seems like a perfect adventure to embark on: to be a cat‚Äôs shadow. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd learn a lot.</p><p>For now though, I‚Äôd just like to tell you one more time that I‚Äôm super grateful to have met you and watch your growth from a little cub who came on my lap immediately, to this wonderful healthy young adult that you now are.</p><p>I wish you all that is most beautiful for you in the coming year, although I have limited understanding of what it might be.</p><p>Thank you for Being,<br />Micha≈Ç</p><p>ps.

            "content_text": "I wrote this letter to a dear friend after a multi-year gap in communications. It was always on my mind to write to her, but somehow I never did. I guess the letter was waiting for the right time to be channeled and it happened to be today.This is a reminder to myself, and to you, if you so desire, that it‚Äôs always okay to reconnect with Beautiful Souls encountered on the journey of life.‚òΩIt‚Äôs been a while since I wrote this kind of letter to a friend, so thanks for the opportunity. And, first of all ‚Äì HELLO!!! You can perhaps feel a wholehearted playful hugging energy arriving into your body as you read these words.I‚Äôm sitting on a floor in a tiny wooden cabin, 3x3 meters, in the middle of a beautiful forest with a view towards the ocean surrounding this wonderful island which is my home for almost 2 years. The island is called Pico, and you can find it around 1/3 way from continental Portugal towards the US. I came here for two months during my nomadic traveling period, and never took the flight back. In fact, I‚Äôm now looking for land, whether in this island, or the neighbouring one called Faial (there are 9 islands in the Azores archipelago). It‚Äôs a wonderful place. If you ever feel like visiting, you‚Äôre more than welcome.It‚Äôs a very particular time in my life because recently, close to the November‚Äôs Full Moon, a new cycle of my life has begun. It was not something that I expected, and it hit me suddenly without any notice, during the last night in Lisbon, before coming back to the Azores. This new cycle is about manifesting dreams.I‚Äôve spent the last few years learning the ropes of entrepreneurship, and it was a tough fucking ride. I really loved the freedom of traveling whenever I want, working for myself and doing something I like doing, but there was also a darker side which manifested in different ways ‚Äì perfectionism, procrastination, stuckness, feeling of lacking, confusion, frustration, disappointment, disillusionment. I‚Äôve learnt a lot through that process, and to be honest with you, I had a total blast, despite the challenges. Plus I got to travel to some amazing places. Japan, which I absolutely adored. Thailand, which changed me deeply. Edinburgh, which I revisited for a short while and experienced the contrast between my new and the old self who used to live there for seven years. I feel like Edinburgh will always be a very special place for me. A lot of the processes which are happening now started there, many years ago. Ah, and I also spent some time housesitting, which was a wonderful opportunity to stay in some exciting homes, but primarily, to connect with animals on a deeper level. Btw, around an hour ago, a cat that lives with me, Kiki, was defending the house from some forest creature, with continuous loud meowing, growling and hissing. It was kinda scary and hilarious at the same time. She‚Äôs quite a character. I guess all cats are.Let me tell you about Dreams.I‚Äôve spent this summer living in a forest, with a dear friend as a neighbour. She‚Äôs a Lithuanian forest witch and a beautiful soul. Being in between the trees right on the ocean cliff was a special moment in space and time. I was sinking into the forest floor every night and felt a growing awareness of what I refer to now as intuition ‚Äì a feeling of what is the next action to take, that is the most beneficial for All. I‚Äôve been tuning myself more and more to it, and whenever I can reach this deep connected state, magical things happen.And then I went from the forest, into the city. I didn‚Äôt feel like leaving from Pico and the Forest, but I broke my front tooth earlier in May, and decided not to be a pirate for life (at least visually speaking) and replace it with a fake one, which was a complicated procedure requiring two trips to the mainland, one in June, one in September. June was the first time I was back in a city environment after over a year in an island without a single traffic light. It was shocking, especially with all the Fear creeping everywhere. And yet, I spent a lot of time dancing in public spaces, being free, and bringing a sense of hope and joy to random people who noticed me around. But I couldn‚Äôt wait to come back to Pico.The trip in September was the most powerful journey in my life so far. After Being in the forest, I‚Äôve been so tuned into myself, that I sunk into a deep meditative state for three weeks. It didn‚Äôt last the whole time of course, but a big chunk of it. I spent most of my waking hours walking. I would wake up, prepare cacao, have some food, and walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk for hours and hours. I often listened to Tibetan gongs as I walked, which kept me grounded and aware. I‚Äôve spent three weeks, going back and forth (by train) between Porto, where my dental appointments were, and Lisbon, where I wanted to be on all the days in between. And then walk and walk and walk in these two cities.As I kept walking, I opened myself to something. I‚Äôve never experienced such an overwhelming amount of synchronicities, beautiful encounters with strangers, and moments of connection. I know that this tends to happen during travels, but this was a whole new level of abundance. I felt touched deeply, noticed numerous patterns in myself which I wasn‚Äôt aware of, and experienced some insights which reframed how I am and want to be in the world.The final part of the trip was holding a wedding ceremony for my dear friend, who didn‚Äôt want to get married in a church, and asked me to perform the ceremony. It was magical. I‚Äôd love to do more of these in the future. If you know of someone who wants to celebrate their love, whether it‚Äôs a romantic relationship or a friendship, with a beautiful ceremony, I‚Äôm available.Shortly after the wedding I went back to Pico, to co-host a community gathering. This is actually worth a quick intermission in between travel stories. My arrival to Pico coincided with coming across a community building framework called microsolidarity. It resonated with me a lot, and I thought ‚Äì hey, let‚Äôs do it in Pico and see what happens. Well‚Ä¶ A year later, we‚Äôve had two gatherings, have a few community projects going, and a few more sprouting over the surface. I feel like I have family in the island, and I have a feeling I‚Äôm not the only person who feels this way. And I‚Äôve taken a role of catalyst and documenter of this community and I‚Äôm really enjoying the process. A big dream for this lifecycle is to co-create Azores Regenerative Network, and travel between the nine islands on a sailboat and catalyse local community projects.So‚Ä¶ I arrive back to Pico, getting ready to host the gathering, and I have this feeling that I need to come back to the Mainland. There‚Äôs something awaiting me there. I kinda waited for an excuse and a few days later I‚Äôve seen an invite to a tree-planting gathering in a part of continental Portugal called Alentejo, so I booked my flights for right after the Pico gathering. From one to another‚Ä¶There was a good reason though.Being in the mainland again, and it really felt like a continuation of the previous trip, but with a different flavour, made some things very clear to me:1) There is a growing amount of people already living in a different culture. By different, I mean not part of the mess of a mainstream capitalist system that‚Äôs eating our souls and the planet. The alternative is not very clearly defined, because we‚Äôre all experimenting, and it takes time, but it‚Äôs based on love, openness, connection, living close to the land, regenerating‚Ä¶ We feel it intuitively. It kinda makes sense that this is growing, considering the hyper pumping of fear in the last few years, and the fact that light requires darkness and vice versa. But it also makes my heart smile. The alternative we‚Äôre creating is just so much more appealing, that it‚Äôs just a matter of time. Of course, there will be some challenges and times of darkness during that time, but all we need to do is shine. The big shift has happened. I was writing about it in my recent Moonly Review, which is a practice that I do for a year now and really enjoy ‚Äì every üåë and üåï I write about what‚Äôs been alive in me in this cycle and publish it. It keeps me accountable and hopefully brings some good vibes to a few people who read it. I really enjoy writing and publishing my words. I‚Äôm now experimenting with reading my letters out loud, but it‚Äôs still something very new.2) My entrepreneurial journey disconnected me a bit from my big dreams. They were still there, but hidden, barely noticeable. It was necessary though, so I can learn how to overcome the challenges I mentioned earlier. But after encountering people who have Big, beautiful dreams and actually manifest a lot of them, I can‚Äôt help but notice that so can I. I‚Äôm not special in that sense, anyone can. It‚Äôs just the matter of finding a way.So, the Dreams.I‚Äôm reconnecting with the practice of writing letters, and I‚Äôd love to do it as a lifestyle. Ideally combined with walking, of course.I‚Äôm catalysing a beautiful community in Pico, and soon beginning my work in the neighbouring islands, as I move towards co-creating an archipelago-wide network. I‚Äôm in the process of making this my paid work, which would be a bliss, although I‚Äôd do it anyway.I‚Äôm living in a tiny house, which is not mine, but it‚Äôs a perfect opportunity to prototype my ideal living scenario ‚Äì a tiny house in the middle of an agroforest, with good friends as neighbours within a walking distance. All I need is to find the land, which is already in the process.I feel called to Brazil, so I‚Äôm co-creating a sailing trip for the next season (Nov/Dec 2022). I met some amazing people in my recent travels and it seems that we can make it happen. It‚Äôs not just about the trip, but also about promoting a different mode of travel ‚Äì slower, rather than faster, and using the time in between for deep personal and relational growth that can benefit the world.There‚Äôs still some blockage around my online journaling business, but I‚Äôm getting more clarity on that ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to keep creating journaling games that help people reconnect with themselves regularly, making it easier to stay aligned and embody their values no matter the challenges that life throws at them.I also dream of a beautiful world where all beings can thrive, and I guess, these are my tiny little roles to play in making it possible.Dreaming is easy though. The challenge is to manifest the dreams.But I feel that in this cycle it is all possible.Let‚Äôs see what happens.‚Ä¶That‚Äôs a bit about what‚Äôs going on in my life right now.Tell me what‚Äôs your world been and is like and what are the Dreams you‚Äôre manifesting!Sending a big hug from the forest üå≥.Micha≈Ç",

It‚Äôs not just about the trip, but also about promoting a different mode of travel ‚Äì slower, rather than faster, and using the time in between for deep personal and relational growth that can benefit the world.</p><p>There‚Äôs still some blockage around my online journaling business, but I‚Äôm getting more clarity on that ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to keep creating journaling games that help people reconnect with themselves regularly, making it easier to stay aligned and embody their values no matter the challenges that life throws at them.</p><p>I also dream of a beautiful world where all beings can thrive, and I guess, these are my tiny little roles to play in making it possible.</p><p>Dreaming is easy though. The challenge is to manifest the dreams.</p><p>But I feel that in this cycle it is all possible.</p><p>Let‚Äôs see what happens.</p><p>‚Ä¶</p><p>That‚Äôs a bit about what‚Äôs going on in my life right now.</p><p>Tell me what‚Äôs your world been and is like and what are the Dreams you‚Äôre manifesting!</p><p>Sending a big hug from the forest üå≥.<br />Micha≈Ç</p>",

            "content_text": "What you‚Äôre about to read could use three sentences of context.I felt stuck with the direction for JournalSmarter, so I decided to write a letter to it. I‚Äôve been recently reconnecting with writing letters, which is one of my favourite things to do. I hope that what this one helps to create will bring you as much joy as it does to me as I finish writing these words of introduction, after reading the whole letter you‚Äôre about to read.Micha≈ÇüìñüéâThe Cabin, 8 December 2021Dear JournalSmarter,It‚Äôs your third birthday, if I remember correctly, and I felt that it is a perfect opportunity to write you a letter. I don‚Äôt think I ever wrote to a brand, but strangely it doesn‚Äôt feel weird at all. Let‚Äôs see what happens.I‚Äôm writing to you because I‚Äôm struggling to figure out what do you want to be. Since I‚Äôm one of your parents, I feel responsible to equip you with everything you need to unfold your wings and fly. I‚Äôm totally in your corner. In fact, I‚Äôm deeply linked with you and you‚Äôll always be a part of my identity, even if our paths might separate one day.I was actually pondering today, as I was walking in my favourite part of the Island, if we should part. It was a precious realisation that we indeed can.  I‚Äôm not enslaved by you in any way. In fact, I choose to give my energy to you and continue on this path, at least for now.But, I admit, I‚Äôm confused about what‚Äôs next.Are you?I‚Äôd really love to connect with you and feel into what do you want. I know that it‚Äôs not just about me, and in fact, the best results are the co-created ones.So‚Ä¶ Would you like to share?‚Ä¶Well‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs unexpected question to answer. I guess‚Ä¶ No, I feel that the name doesn‚Äôt resonate with me very much. It‚Äôs a good, solid name, but it doesn‚Äôt represent accurately what I want to be, which is intuitive journaling. Intuition over mind. Being connected instead of being smart. You get my drift? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with smartness, but you know very well that mind plays tricks, and often disconnects you from what your heart knows.‚Ä¶I see your point. The word ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù has been important for me lately, and intuition is definitely something I‚Äôd like to explore more. And I mean it, not as just yet another thing I say I‚Äôd like to do. This is for real.And journaling plays an important role in that process.In fact, it‚Äôs one of the most effective practices that I do consistently that reconnect me with myself and therefore my intuition. My journal is something I always carry with me. Seriously, people laugh at me, that I always carry my backpack, but I just don‚Äôt want to leave my journal behind wherever I go. It‚Äôs a physical reminder that I can always access any part of myself. Of course, I don‚Äôt really need my journal for that, but it‚Äôs a gateway that makes it much, much easier.‚Ä¶That makes sense. Now, imagine what the world could be like if a lot of people would act from a place of being grounded, aligned and connected with themselves. Whenever you‚Äôre grounded you can face any challenge with peace and kindness. You can stay clear on your path and don‚Äôt get distracted. You can sense-make your experience and filter signal from noise, and consciously decide what to do with it.In a nutshell, being connected with yourself is a powerful state and it shapes whatever it is that you‚Äôre creating with your life. What you do matters, but who you are matters too. Journaling is a daily check, showing you who you really are, on an ongoing basis, which is a precious gift.Do you know why?‚Ä¶Awareness informs action. I‚Äôve experienced that numerous times when connecting with myself on the pages of my journal. But I‚Äôd like to focus our conversation on what you want to become.I feel that you have something more specific to share on that. I‚Äôd really love to hear it!‚Ä¶I‚Äôll get there, but first, an unexpected curve ball.I know that you like documenting the process of making beautiful ideas happen. That‚Äôs essentially a form of public journaling. You log your process, sense-make your experience, and share it with the world. And people appreciate that, because what you are documenting is important to be documented.It‚Äôs not about the format, it‚Äôs about what the format allows.Journaling is a format for self-connection. For cultivating deep self-awareness. For sense-making. For constantly becoming a beautiful person.There are thousand ways, or specific formats if you‚Äôd like, for how this can be done, and this is your freaking superpower ‚Äì you can turn anything into a journaling practice and share it in a clear and actionable way that‚Äôs fun to do. You‚Äôre creating games. Journaling Games. That‚Äôs a good name, by the way, keep a note of it, but don‚Äôt get too attached, okay? It‚Äôs not about the freaking name. It‚Äôs about what journaling allows ‚Äì¬†realigning daily and moving forward on the path no matter the challenge.Now, here‚Äôs another important component, so pay attention ‚Äì this process can benefit anyone, but you‚Äôve learned the hard way that in the digital world this doesn‚Äôt work. But it‚Äôs not just about for specific target audience you define through some marketing framework, but about people who resonate with the vibe you are creating.Let me tell you about my vibe.It‚Äôs a vibe of play. Kindness. Making the world a better place, starting today and continuing tomorrow. It‚Äôs a vibe of joy and appreciating life for the beauty the world showers us with everyday. It‚Äôs a vibe of encouragement to keep going, especially when it‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs about encouraging people to shine. You know how to do this. You are already doing it. You always were. So why do you feel so stuck? Because, here‚Äôs the punch ‚Äì¬†you actually aren‚Äôt.‚Ä¶Hmm‚Ä¶ Thank you for saying that. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it, but then again, I wasn‚Äôt expecting to write a letter to a brand I‚Äôve created. I feel like laughing for a bit, so I will, I hope that‚Äôs okay.In fact I‚Äôll take a moment to move my body a little bit, because I really need it. It‚Äôs beautiful to notice that as I write this I‚Äôm becoming more and more connected with myself. Thank you for that. That‚Äôs the magic of writing letters.(He dances.)It‚Äôs funny.Whenever I start dancing good things happen.I feel much, much clearer on what is your vision for yourself.A playful reminder to journal.An inspiring guide showing not only what you can do with your journal (so you are excited about it), but also what is the magic that happens when you stay connected with yourself, which journaling helps you do regularly.A community of people encouraging each other to co-create a beautiful world where all beings can thrive, with a funky, creative, loving, and playful flavour.An infinite game worth playing and inviting others to play.The rest is figuring out some technical details of how to set it all up. Luckily, I‚Äôm going to talk to someone who can help me with this tomorrow. How wonderful.I guess that concludes my letter to you.Happy Birthday, JournalSmarter!üìñ‚ú®",

            "content_text": "Published: 2021-12-01Let‚Äôs begin with a bit of context:I‚Äôve been location independent from 2017 and I absolutely love the freedom of being able to move whenever I feel it‚Äôs the right time to do it. There is however a price to pay for that freedom: the pain of saying goodbye to people dear to your heart, knowing that you might never see them again. Life is unpredictable.I admit, that even if I traveled with a partner, there were times during my travels when I felt quite lonely. I did encounter many wonderful Souls, and the connections were intense but also short. I lacked continuity.One day I decided to make a list of people I intuitively felt like reaching out to. Some were close friends, and others were people I shared a single powerful moment sometime, somewhere. The following day I sent them all a message.Some people replied and we had a call, others replied and that was it. Some never replied at all. I considered it a ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù. There‚Äôs time and space for each connection. No hard feelings. With some people however I felt a clear ‚Äúconnection match‚Äù and some developed into beautiful friendships.The next step was to experiment with different frequencies for calls. I found that different intervals work better for each relationship ‚Äì the rarer the call, the more ‚Äúmacro‚Äù the perspective. With some people it feels more natural to stay close to each other and reflect together on things that are alive right now, and with others it feels wonderful to look together at an entire year of our lives and share whatever comes up to the surface.In the process, I also discovered that I generally prefer audio-only calls. Video is nice, but I‚Äôd rather go for a walk rather than stare at a computer screen. With time, I gravitated towards async connections, such as long voice-notes, emails and letters.In a few months, I eradicated the feeling of loneliness, and nurtured myself with recurring 1:1 conversations with people I love.Microsolidarity ExperimentsDiscovering microsolidarity in the beginning of 2020 was a huge milestone for me.Microsolidarity gave me vocabulary to operate with and served as a practical guide to weaving wonderful social interactions at a bigger scale, with a possibility of changing the world together.Three ideas really struck a deeper chord:1) People before projects ‚Äì&gt; start with finding the people that you can co-create magic with2) Different group sizes serve different purposes ‚Äì&gt; large groups serve as a ‚Äúdating pool‚Äù to find your small groups where the magic happens3) Verbs &gt; Nouns ‚Äì&gt; theory is useful, but focus on the practiceI sat down and made another list.I let the names sink in for some time, feeling into small groups that would make sense to call into existence. When it felt right, I reached out to some people with an idea of launching ‚Äúmastermind groups‚Äù (which was the vocabulary more familiar to the people I was reaching out to).Here‚Äôs a part of an email exchange with one of the people I reached out to, introducing the idea of co-creating a group.Over the next few months I launched a few crews:  The Unicorns ü¶Ñ - digital, 4 people (2 couples), mutual support, March 2020 - January 2021  Team Angie ‚ö°Ô∏è - digital, 4 people, exploring different topics related to emotional development, May 2020 - May 2021  Loverz Powerz üíú - digital, 4 people (2 couples), relationship-focused, May 2020 - May 2021  Routine Bootcamp üöÄ - digital, 3 people, building routines together based on Metagame Mastermind Format (youtube video), June - November 2020  The Circle ‚ö™Ô∏è - presential, 4 housemates, weekly sharing circle followed by a co-living talk, February - June 2020  Pico Sharing Circle üåÄ - presential, ~10 people, bi-weekly sharing circle, which eventually grew into an entire congregation. Here‚Äôs the documentation of the circle.A few reflections:  While I took the responsibility of being the caller (the person who calls the pod to existence), I deliberately let go of my default facilitating posture and practiced co-creating together. The crews usually started with one or two ‚Äúmeta calls‚Äù diving into our intentions and deciding how do we want to be together, including technicalities such as rhythm, format etc.  Crews had a timeframe agreed in advance. Each cycle was closed with a retrospective when we decided what‚Äôs the next step, for example closing the crew or beginning another cycle.  Even if we committed to the schedule set up in advance, there was always at least one call that we had to skip due to life being life (na-na-na-na-na). Pods tended to work better with meetings no further than one month apart.  Keeping a recording was kinda useless, but we all enjoyed sharing our notes with each other  I kept a log of each pod for learning purposes. I‚Äôm very grateful that I did, because I‚Äôm looking at them as I write this article.  I loved the process of coming up with the crew name together.üëÅ Key Insight:Start your microsolidarity journey by calling a crew (or a couple of them). Today is a perfect day to do it. You‚Äôll learn all the skills you need along the way, and who knows - your crew(s) might eventually grow into a congregation.Check out the resources at the end of this article if you need some extra help.EnspiralIn September 2021 I joined Enspiral, a network of people helping each other do more meaningful work. The network design includes pods (equivalent to crews in microslidarity lingo) to support building relationships within the network. While I haven‚Äôt joined any pods, mostly due to all the other crews I had going on at the time, I got involved in Enspiral Europe Connection Working Group hosting bi-weekly Connection Calls for Enspiralites based in Europe.Growing a congregation in Pico IslandWhat happened in Pico surpassed my wildest dreams.In a bit over one year since our very first sharing circle, we hosted two community gatherings, launch numerous projects, and created a strong foundation for a thriving congregation.The most surprising part is that it was actually quite simple. I called a sharing circle, and as people started to spend time getting to know each other on a deeper level, magic started to happen. Of course, as we‚Äôre maturing as a congregation we‚Äôll encounter challenges. That‚Äôs just a part of the process. With a strong foundation of relationships based on trust, care and support, we‚Äôre ready for our next iterations.I document the process thoroughly here.üëÅ Key insight:It seems that at this point I became a microsolidarity practitioner and a congregation catalyst. I attribute my progress to two core competencies developed over time:1) practicing crewing ‚Äì&gt; there‚Äôs no learning without practice, and no amount of theory will teach you how to be and co-create together with the real people around you.2) documenting the process ‚Äì&gt; publishing my process as an open-source documentation allowed me to regularly reflect on my learning journey. It also created beautiful connections with people who reached out to me with appreciation, questions, feedback and co-creating possibilities.If there‚Äôs one advice I could give to a microsolidarity beginner, it‚Äôs to do these two things from the start. I‚Äôm available to help if you could benefit from it.Looking Beyond PicoIn June 2021 I felt a call to connect with Faial, one of the neighbour islands. As I hiked through its forests and volcanoes, I realised that the most wonderful thing about Pico (for me) is that it is a part of an archipelago containing nine islands, each with its own unique energy and people.One reason why I love islands, is that each of them feels like an entire world. While clearly limited by water and no matter how small, it also feels infinite. There‚Äôs just so much to explore. I guess you can tell where I‚Äôm going with this. The Azores is not just one world ‚Äì it‚Äôs a Galaxy.I guess it comes without surprise that my next step is to catalyse Azores Regenerative Network, and plant microsolidarity seeds in all islands, while integrating it with my life-long dream of sailing.The soil is fertile and the people are already doing the Work.Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs going to sprout from the seeds that we are planting together.üå±GratitudeThis post wouldn‚Äôt be complete without expressing my deepest gratitude to Rich Bartlett (twitter link) for compiling Microsolidarity and supporting countless people and projects around the world to co-create a beautiful world where all Beings can thrive üíú.Also, a wholehearted hug goes to everyone with whom I got to practice microsolidarity together.

            "content_html": "<p><em>Published: 2021-12-01</em></p><p>Let‚Äôs begin with a bit of context:</p><p>I‚Äôve been location independent from 2017 and I absolutely love the freedom of being able to move whenever I feel it‚Äôs the right time to do it. There is however a price to pay for that freedom: <strong>the pain of saying goodbye to people dear to your heart, knowing that you might never see them again</strong>. Life is unpredictable.</p><p>I admit, that even if I traveled with a partner, there were times during my travels when I felt quite lonely. I did encounter many wonderful Souls, and the connections were intense but also short. I lacked continuity.</p><p>One day <strong>I decided to make a list of people I intuitively felt like reaching out to</strong>. Some were close friends, and others were people I shared a single powerful moment sometime, somewhere. The following day I sent them all a message.</p><p>Some people replied and we had a call, others replied and that was it. Some never replied at all. I considered it a ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù. <strong>There‚Äôs time and space for each connection</strong>. No hard feelings. With some people however I felt a clear ‚Äúconnection match‚Äù and some developed into beautiful friendships.</p><p>The next step was to <strong>experiment with different frequencies for calls</strong>. I found that different intervals work better for each relationship ‚Äì the rarer the call, the more ‚Äúmacro‚Äù the perspective. With some people it feels more natural to stay close to each other and reflect together on things that are alive right now, and with others it feels wonderful to look together at an entire year of our lives and share whatever comes up to the surface.</p><p>In the process, I also discovered that <strong>I generally prefer audio-only calls</strong>. Video is nice, but I‚Äôd rather go for a walk rather than stare at a computer screen. With time, I gravitated towards async connections, such as long voice-notes, emails and letters.</p><p>In a few months, I eradicated the feeling of loneliness, and nurtured myself with recurring 1:1 conversations with people I love.</p><h2 id=\"microsolidarity-experiments\">Microsolidarity Experiments</h2><p>Discovering <a href=\"https://microsolidarity.cc\" target=\"_blank\">microsolidarity</a> in the beginning of 2020 was a huge milestone for me.</p><p><strong>Microsolidarity gave me vocabulary to operate with and served as a practical guide to weaving wonderful social interactions at a bigger scale, with a possibility of changing the world together.</strong></p><p>Three ideas really struck a deeper chord:</p><p>1) <strong>People before projects</strong> ‚Äì&gt; start with finding the people that you can co-create magic with<br />2) <strong>Different group sizes serve different purposes</strong> ‚Äì&gt; large groups serve as a ‚Äúdating pool‚Äù to find your small groups where the magic happens<br />3) <strong>Verbs &gt; Nouns</strong> ‚Äì&gt; theory is useful, but focus on the practice</p><p>I sat down and made another list.</p><p><img src=\"web/michalroots.github.io/assets/who-are-the-people.jpg\" alt=\"Who Are The People?\" /></p><p>I let the names sink in for some time, feeling into small groups that would make sense to call into existence.

One of the biggest difficulties revolves around money. In a nutshell: I feel very little alignment with the current capitalist system and I‚Äôd like to embody a different paradigm.But that isn‚Äôt easy when I depend on my own business to bring income. On one hand I am fully committed to release products that genuinely enrich lives and contribute to co-creating a beautiful planet where all beings can thrive. On the other, I feel pressure to make enough to pay the basic expenses. With the entrepreneurial world saturated with content prioritizing making more money rather than why and how aligned, it‚Äôs been hard to stay grounded and maintain a relatively steady course aligned with what my heart believes in.But it‚Äôs been kinda working lately, and I feel that my work is tuning in more and more with my values, while bringing in enough financially to sustain my basic needs, and leaving more time and energy to give freely to work that matters that I don‚Äôt want to charge for within the capitalist economy.Because, I deeply believe that not everything should be monetized.Regenerating the land.Healing oneself and others.Sharing the Light to inspire and encourage more people to enter into the upwards spiral of the beautiful world that our hearts know is possible 1.These are my priorities, and while I‚Äôm committed to this path anyway, I could certainly use your help. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this letter to ask you for a Gift.As a minimalist on a constant journey to have less items and more space, I learned that offering a gift is a beautiful but challenging art. For example, for a long time my family kept giving me stuff, which while being given from the heart and therefore appreciated, was, generally speaking, useless for me and only created unnecessary clutter.What I learned through this process is:a) experiences generally make much better gifts for me.b) it is my responsibility to communicate clearly which gifts are the most aligned with what my heart points me towards right now, instead of expecting another person to know that intuitively.This letter is an externalisation of these two lessons in a form of a public wishlist, supported by a firm belief that there is plenty of abundance of different sorts all around, and that within the Gift Economy (which we are indeed all a part of) the gifts gravitate towards the place where they are needed most.I‚Äôm not saying that the items on my list are universally speaking the biggest voids in the universe waiting to be filled. I already have all that I need. However, it is possible that you are in a position to fill these voids for me, and thus make a real positive impact in my life, and, through ripple effect, the lives of others.Whether that‚Äôs the case or not, I‚Äôm grateful for your presence, and I wish you wonderful Winter Holidays, whichever and whenever you choose to celebrate.With Love and Gratitude,Micha≈Ç.ps.

            "content_text": "The first New Moon of 2022 is a perfect time to share with you my Yearly Review.It‚Äôs been a very special year in my life ‚Äì¬†it marked the beginning of a New Cycle, which I wish to be all about manifesting dreams. I feel like everything that happened this year was a long process of integrating everything that happened in my life so far, and preparing me for something new.Here‚Äôs the drawing of my year:I tell you a bit more about it, using a few scans from the pages of my 2021 journals, captured during my yearly review.Enjoy üíúYear of SquaresThe year begins with the Squares of course.You‚Äôll notice that they changed quite significantly through the year. This is the page that took me from 15 Nov 2020 to 12 Jan 2021.Squares were a major theme of the year. I finally figured out what they are really about, and what is the most effective and fun way for me to inspire others to play along. In September I finally transformed the unpronounceable Minimalist Journaling System into Infinity Squares, and launched a brand new email-based course.As you can see below, my squares evolved a lot. Here‚Äôs September 2021:And in case you‚Äôre wondering, I still haven‚Äôt skipped a single one in over 1400 days. It is the most fundamental self-alignment practice in my life.On the other hand, I also realised that I need to make space in my professional life. I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of confusion around JournalSmarter, which led to writing a letter to it (as in to the brand itself), where I tried to inquire what does JS want to become. After a long and painful process, I‚Äôve decided to radically simplify my entire approach and launched (today) a new website. JournalSmarter will no longer be my main professional focus, in order to make space for what I feel called to do (more on that later). I‚Äôll still keep the courses going and add a new journaling game / course whenever I feel like it. I also have a few pieces of the journaling puzzle that are ready to be published, so I‚Äôll make than happen in the next few days. And then it‚Äôs time to breathe.Paradoxically, by removing all the financial pressure from JournalSmarter, as well as radically simplifying how it works, I have a feeling that this project will be more successful than ever. And I admit that the moment of insight which lead me to describe journaling as an infinite game unlocked something that has been stuck for a long time.Welcome to JournalSmarter 3.0. I hope that it will bring you a lot of joy.üìñ‚ú®Year of PracticeIn December 2019 I had this crazy idea to offer a year-long cohort-based course, where I‚Äôll take 20 people on a journey of building 3 practices of their choice through the year.I‚Äôm still due to write an in-depth documentation article on that journey, so I won‚Äôt go into more details now, and instead I‚Äôll share about my own practices. Funny enough, they were completely different from what I expected them to be.BeingIn the summer I felt a call to ditch the comforts of a house and moved into a forest. It has been the most impactful summer of my life, along with 2013 (when I hitchhiked from Scotland to Greece) and 2017 (when I said goodbye to Edinburgh and began location independent life).Photo by Austeja LiuBeing in the forest started a deep process of reconnection with myself, tuning into my intuition, which allowed me to rediscover what is important to me and how I want to manifest it. I am forever grateful to Jean-Daniel who allowed me to live on his land, as well as Austeja and Niko, who were my forest neighbours.I started to write poetry and letters again, I felt free like I haven‚Äôt in a couple of years, and I have learnt a few critical lessons, which I then integrated on a trip to the Mainland Portugal in September, which blew my mind beyond anything I knew before.WalkingThe seed of walking has been planted during my little camino in Faial island. I felt called to go there and connect with the island, and instead of cycling or driving I wanted to walk. So I walked for three days pretty much non-stop, covering the entire island, climbing up and down volcanoes, and sleeping in a hammock in the forest.In September, I spent three weeks walking in Lisbon and Porto, for most of my waking hours. Soon after walking up I‚Äôd leave the house and began walking, walking, walking and come back late at night to sleep and then walk again the following day.I have never reached the level of self-awareness before that trip. I‚Äôve experienced unprecedented abundance, flow of synchronicities, moments of beauty, unexpected beautiful connections with people and other beings, and powerful insights.I don‚Äôt really have words to describe it just yet.I wrote ‚ÄúI want to‚Äù and then decided to strike it through, as ‚ÄúI am‚Äù walking and writing stories. It is happening already. And if you‚Äôre curious about what was the story written below, it is here and it was a moment of vulnerable and hilarious insight.In 2021, walking became my meditation. My way of Being. My lifestyle.It‚Äôs all I need in order to encounter and create Magic. And Magic is precisely what I‚Äôm after.Making SpaceCreating spaces for magic to emerge is something that I feel called for, and it‚Äôs also when I feel like fish in the sea.This year was special in that regard.I co-hosted the first community gathering in Pico, which was a game-changer for the community. Before the gathering I used to feel that I have friends in the island. After the gathering I had a family.I took this energy further with our second gathering, designed to 1) help each of us to understand what kind of community do we want to be a part of, and 2) find ways to support each other to make these visions come true in the context of our island. It was a very special moment for our community and for me, as a catalyst. Here‚Äôs a community catalysing game I prototyped during the gathering.I still remember the crazy brainstorming session when the game idea came to me:I‚Äôve also created a performance with Austeja, which moved local people and kids in ways that we haven‚Äôt expected. We also co-created a more events in Pico, such as Slam Jam, Masking Around, and more. We also had our bi-weekly sharing circle and a drum crew. Loads and Loads of spaces and even more magical moments that emerged from there.I‚Äôve also had the honour to create a wedding ceremony for a dear friend and his lovely partner. I loved it and I‚Äôm game for creating more ceremonies. Call me üòâ.Apart from making spaces in real life, I‚Äôve also created some powerful digital experiences, such as Year of Practice (a year-long practice-building community), Habit Sprint (a three-month, focused version), Relational Weekly Review (a weekly co-journaling session boosted with relational growth), *Enspiral Europe Connection Weekend (an experiment in weaving social fabric in the European part of Enspiral network) and more.Intermission: Top Songs, Films, and Books of 2021.Three Songs That Moved MeAdult Jazz - Springfulbandcamp | spotifyAs I was about to depart for a trip that would turn out to be the most powerful journey in my life so far, I asked my best friend for a gift: a few songs to go along with me. Springful was the one that created a powerful emotional shift inside of me, and prompted me to dance, dance, dance and then dance some more, as I was deepening my self-awareness reaching unprecedented levels, while walking for hours in the streets of Lisbon and Porto.It is one of these few songs that will always stay with me, reminding me of this very special moment in my personal history whenever I get to listen to it.Milo - Folk Metaphysics soundcloud | spotify lyricsI remember the moment when this song came into my headphones for the first time. I paused. I listen to it, and then listened to it on repeat a few times to really understand the lyrics. There‚Äôs something about this song that puts me in a very special state of Being  ‚Äì¬†humble, honest, creative, melancholic, connected.Milo is one of the most important poets I discovered this year, and I highly recommend his work.Climbing Poetree - Awakeningbancamp| spotify lyricsSpeaking of poets, here‚Äôs two of them, united in a raw and powerful force of nature poetry. Listening to this song (and a few other ones) make me shiver, and there are not many songs that can do that.Note:I deliberately avoided youtube links for the songs, as I‚Äôm on a quest to set myself free from google. It‚Äôs not an easy task and it requires practice.Three Films that I absolutely lovedThe Twentieth Century MubiIncredible example of neo-German-expressionism, depicting the story of a Canadian prime minister rising to power. The vibe is really quite something, and it‚Äôs good old-school set design, not computer generated stuff.The Brick WikipediaDear, oh dear, what a feast.The dialogue, the characters, the intrigue, the cinematography‚Ä¶ I loved all of it. And translating the tropes of noir into American high-school environment works exceptionally well. Make no mistake ‚Äì this is nothing like a typical American high-school comedy. Brick is a piece of art.One of my favourite moments is the conversation when the hero rejects help from la famme:  BRENDANLook, I can‚Äôt trust you. You ought to be smart enough to know that. I didn‚Äôt shake up the party to get your attention, and I‚Äôm not heeling you to hook you. Your connections could help me, but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me. Better off coming at it clean.  LAURAI wouldn‚Äôt have to lead you in by the‚Ä¶  BRENDANI can‚Äôt trust you. Brad was a sap, you weren‚Äôt. You‚Äôre with him, so you‚Äôre playing him. So you‚Äôre a player. With you behind me, I‚Äôd have to tie one eye up, watching both of your hands. I can‚Äôt spare it.You‚Äôre absolutely right, Brendan. She is a player indeed.Another Round MubiFour school teachers embark on an experiment to prove an obscure theory: maintain a constant level of alcohol to see if it will make them happy. The result is a wonderfully dark comedy from the magnificent Scandinavian school of film-making.Speaking of good films, I can‚Äôt recommend MUBI enough. The curation is amazing, and instead of force-feeding whatever into your throat like Netflix, Mubi actually helps you find cinematic gems. This link gets you (and me) a free month.Honorable mention: A Gathering of the TribeA powerful, 9 minute short, perfectly fitting for our current times. It really touched me.Youtube linkBook of the YearSacred Economics by Charles Eisenstein. No doubt here.In fact, I find Charles to be one of the most important writers of today‚Äôs world. I can‚Äôt recommend checking out his work on Substack. Here‚Äôs one of the recent essays that expressed very accurately a lot of my feelings regarding that virus: A Path Will Rise to Meet Us.The Alternative Culture is here. All we need to do is shine ‚ú®Most of all, the 2021 shown me that the (for a lack of better word) global capitalist culture is not only complete bullshit (this I knew for a long time), but the alternative is already here and so many people already made the shift. It‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs happening. No more excuses and keeping the hamster wheel going.It‚Äôs been such a privilege to learn from and with all the wonderful souls I‚Äôve met this year. Here are a few of them:And there were oh so many.It‚Äôs not that the change is coming.It is right here, right now.All we need to do is shine ‚ú®.And, of course, NO FEAR.Fear is heart killer.Gratitude MandalaSpeaking of the people I‚Äôve been lucky to meet‚Ä¶Every year I draw a Gratitude Mandala, which includes beings I‚Äôm grateful for in the year that has ended. It‚Äôs a part of my yearly review since 2019.Here‚Äôs the mandala for 2021:Since I‚Äôve been reconnecting with my letter writing practice recently, I‚Äôve decided to write as many letters to as many of these wonderful souls as possible. Some of the letters will be public, and I‚Äôll keep adding them here.For now, there‚Äôs only a letter to Kiki, the wonderful cat that lives with me, which is an absolutely amazing being, and I‚Äôve learn a lot from her.And hey, since you are here right now:THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF MY LIFE.üíú üíú üíúSetting a new course for 2022New Lunar Year is a good moment to adjust the course I‚Äôm taking in life.I still feel like doing a bit more internal soul-searching in that field, but the direction is clear.My #1 priority in 2022 is to create and document regenerative communities.It seems like it‚Äôs a perfect Ikigai ‚Äì a direction encompassing something the world needs, something I‚Äôm good at, something I love doing and something I can get paid for. I wrote a sweet article about it a long time ago, and I actually feel like revisiting the exercises I shared there.But for now, here‚Äôs a hypothesis:If I make more space for my community catalysing activities and keep documenting what I do and how I do it (whether in Pico, the Azores, or digital) my work will create a serious ripple effect inspiring and encouraging people to create their own communities and regenerative projects. And part of that ripple effect will come back to me in the form of gratitude and financial support allowing me to do more meaningful work in that area.In other words, instead of pushing to sell products, I‚Äôd rather be supported by people who believe that what I do is important, and who want to help me make it happen. So, I‚Äôve set up a Patreon account and I‚Äôm excited to see what happens. It‚Äôd mean the world to me if you would consider being a part of that journey.You can see what I‚Äôm focusing on here.I wish you Freedom, Joy and Fulfilment. Let‚Äôs co-create a beautiful world where all beings can thrive. It‚Äôs possible. All we need to do is shine ‚ú®.Thank you for Being,Micha≈Çps. Since this is a New Moon, I‚Äôm due my Moonly video. But that will still take a moment. I‚Äôll update it here when ready.",

Here‚Äôs one of the recent essays that expressed very accurately a lot of my feelings regarding <em>that</em> virus: <em><a href=\"https://charleseisenstein.substack.com/p/a-path-will-rise-to-meet-us\" target=\"_blank\">A Path Will Rise to Meet Us</a></em>.</p><hr /><h2 id=\"the-alternative-culture-is-here-all-we-need-to-do-is-shine-\">The Alternative Culture is here. All we need to do is shine ‚ú®</h2><p>Most of all, the 2021 shown me that the (for a lack of better word) global capitalist culture is not only complete bullshit (this I knew for a long time), but the alternative is already here and so many people already made the shift. It‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs happening. No more excuses and keeping the hamster wheel going.</p><p>It‚Äôs been such a privilege to learn from and with all the wonderful souls I‚Äôve met this year. Here are a few of them:</p><p><img src=\"/assets/new-culture.jpeg\" alt=\"A few people I met\" /></p><p>And there were oh so many.</p><p>It‚Äôs not that the change is coming.</p><p>It is right here, right now.</p><p>All we need to do is shine ‚ú®.</p><p>And, of course, NO FEAR.</p><p>Fear is heart killer.</p><h2 id=\"gratitude-mandala\">Gratitude Mandala</h2><p>Speaking of the people I‚Äôve been lucky to meet‚Ä¶</p><p>Every year I draw a <a href=\"https://journalsmarter.com/gratitude-mandala\" target=\"_blank\">Gratitude Mandala</a>, which includes beings I‚Äôm grateful for in the year that has ended. It‚Äôs a part of my yearly review since 2019.</p><p>Here‚Äôs the mandala for 2021:</p><p><img src=\"/assets/gratitude-mandala-2021.jpg\" alt=\"Gratitude Mandala 2021\" /></p><p>Since I‚Äôve been reconnecting with my letter writing practice recently, I‚Äôve decided to write as many letters to as many of these wonderful souls as possible. Some of the letters will be public, and I‚Äôll keep adding them <a href=\"/gratitude-mandala-2021\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>For now, there‚Äôs only a letter to Kiki, the wonderful cat that lives with me, which is an absolutely amazing being, and I‚Äôve learn a lot from her.</p><p>And hey, since you are here right now:</p><p><strong>THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF MY LIFE.</strong></p><p>üíú üíú üíú</p><h2 id=\"setting-a-new-course-for-2022\">Setting a new course for 2022</h2><p>New Lunar Year is a good moment to adjust the course I‚Äôm taking in life.</p><p>I still feel like doing a bit more internal soul-searching in that field, but the direction is clear.</p><p><strong>My #1 priority in 2022 is to create and document regenerative communities.</strong></p><p>It seems like it‚Äôs a perfect <em>Ikigai</em> ‚Äì a direction encompassing something the world needs, something I‚Äôm good at, something I love doing and something I can get paid for. I wrote a <a href=\"https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-chart-a-new-course-for-your-life-with-3-simple-diagrams-e9cc6b59c49d?sk=9afa2b3f5abcec0c48774bf022b1ef77\" target=\"_blank\">sweet article</a> about it a long time ago, and I actually feel like revisiting the exercises I shared there.</p><p>But for now, here‚Äôs a hypothesis:</p><p><strong>If I make more space for my community catalysing activities and keep documenting what I do and how I do it (whether in <a href=\"https://pico.microsolidarity.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Pico</a>, the Azores, or digital) my work will create a serious ripple effect inspiring and encouraging people to create their own communities and regenerative projects. And part of that ripple effect will come back to me in the form of gratitude and financial support allowing me to do more meaningful work in that area.</strong></p><p>In other words, instead of pushing to sell products, I‚Äôd rather be supported by people who believe that what I do is important, and who want to help me make it happen. So, I‚Äôve set up a <a href=\"https://patreon.com/michalkorzonek\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon account</a> and I‚Äôm excited to see what happens. It‚Äôd mean the world to me if you would consider being a part of that journey.</p><p>You can see what I‚Äôm focusing on <a href=\"/focus\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><hr /><p>I wish you Freedom, Joy and Fulfilment. Let‚Äôs co-create a beautiful world where all beings can thrive. It‚Äôs possible. All we need to do is shine ‚ú®.</p><p>Thank you for Being,<br />Micha≈Ç</p><p>ps.

Tweet me.Using Google is a habitAs I embarked on this journey, I noticed that quitting google is very similar to quitting a bad habit. Over numerous year of interacting with the internet, I have conditioned myself to default to google, and it‚Äôs not easy at all to give it up.This is a powerful realisation, because I am a certified habit building coach, and I have worked with clients (and myself) in the area of habit building for quite some time. This means I know exactly how to approach this situation effectively, or at least give it my best shot.The critical idea in habit-building is to steadily keep moving forward with a tiny habit, rather than overcommitting. This is why I don‚Äôt intend to migrate away from google in a week or so, but rather see it as an ongoing process, which I‚Äôm going to document here.Here‚Äôs my (ongoing) process:‚úÖGoogle ChromeI always preferred Firefox. Brave is cool too (I use it on mobile). Easy peasy.Google SearchMojeek + DuckDuckGoI swapped to DuckDuckGo years ago and it used to be my default search engine until I read this amazing article exploring private search engines. Turns out DDG stores some information, plus it is US-based, which doesn‚Äôt inspire my confidence at all.I‚Äôve decided to move to Mojeek as my primary search, and supplement it with DDG whenever necessary.Youtube for musicSpotifyI‚Äôve quit youtube for music when I joined Spotify. I have a family premium account. Other alternatives I like are Soundcloud and Bandcamp . The latter is a great way of supporting artists I love financially and downloading music for offline use, which will come in handy when I move to a sailboat ‚õµÔ∏è.‚è≥Google DriveCryptdriveI love cryptdrive and it was a no-brainer to switch. I‚Äôm using it for all new files, but I still need to migrate documents from Google Drive.Unfortunately, this is one of these things that have a tendency of sending me down a rabbit hole of over organising folders etc. I admit my drive is a combination of well organised PARA system and a folder with all the mess that I made over the years, which I never got to really clean up.It‚Äôs worth noting here that I‚Äôm redesigning my computer experience for offline-first and obsidian-centered.GmailProtonmailAfter going on a rabbit hole of research triggered by this article  about secure emails, I reached a conclusion that there is no fully private option on the market. Even Protonmail and Tutanota have serious issues.After considering different pros and cons, I made my decision to go with protonmail. It‚Äôs not perfect, but definitely better than gmail.Unfortunately, this is where the migration becomes tricky.1) All my digital world relies on multiple @gmail addresses and the process of moving to Proton is essentially an opportunity to practice one of the virtues I‚Äôm not so good at ‚Äì patience.2) My recovering-perfectionist mind wants me to create a perfect combination of email addresses, for personal, work and secret purposes.The habit-building work begins here. I created my free protonmail account and started using it for creating new accounts, subscriptions etc. I‚Äôll eventually move to a paid plan, as I ditch my business google accounts.Google CalendarProton CalendarThere are three problems with Proton Calendar:  the design on mobile is quite poor for my use case, and since I have to use the dedicated app I can‚Äôt fix it with a third-party app  development cycles in Proton are ridiculously long.  can it work with calendly or other scheduling tool?For now I started migrating some of my events there, and I‚Äôll continue the process over time.Youtube‚ö†Ô∏è research phase: D.tube and OdyseeI just caught myself automatically going to youtube to look for something (LYT obsidian videos), which yet again brings me back to the idea that quitting Google is like quitting a bad habit.I noticed though, so I went on to try alternatives.

Start with the opening, end with the closing, and pick other rounds to go through as desired. Note that new communities tend to call numerous projects, and it might be beneficial to extend the Round of Calls during the first game, even if you‚Äôd have to skip the other rounds. Play it by ear.Allow around two hours to play the game. It‚Äôs hard to keep focus in the group for longer.The game can be played as a recurring activity, for example monthly or bi-annually, providing a rhythm to the community.The game is designed for presential play in a group of 5-15 people, although it can be adapted for a different group size, as well as virtual play.Use this manual as a blueprint and create new iterations of the game that would suit better the context of your community.Feel free to share your experiments with me ‚Äì you‚Äôll find my contact details at the end of this manual.Materials  Big piece of paper (ideally A3 or bigger) for the Community Map  Pens or pencils, one per person  (optional, but useful) one permanent marker  counters (eg. stones, dried chickpea), three per person  post-its or index cards, four per person  up to four blank sheets of A4 paper for the list(s) that will be created during the game.

            "content_text": "I wrote this letter to a dear friend after a multi-year gap in communications. It was always on my mind to write to her, but somehow I never did. I guess the letter was waiting for the right time to be channeled and it happened to be today.This is a reminder to myself, and to you, if you so desire, that it‚Äôs always okay to reconnect with Beautiful Souls encountered on the journey of life.‚òΩIt‚Äôs been a while since I wrote this kind of letter to a friend, so thanks for the opportunity. And, first of all ‚Äì HELLO!!! You can perhaps feel a wholehearted playful hugging energy arriving into your body as you read these words.I‚Äôm sitting on a floor in a tiny wooden cabin, 3x3 meters, in the middle of a beautiful forest with a view towards the ocean surrounding this wonderful island which is my home for almost 2 years. The island is called Pico, and you can find it around 1/3 way from continental Portugal towards the US. I came here for two months during my nomadic traveling period, and never took the flight back. In fact, I‚Äôm now looking for land, whether in this island, or the neighbouring one called Faial (there are 9 islands in the Azores archipelago). It‚Äôs a wonderful place. If you ever feel like visiting, you‚Äôre more than welcome.It‚Äôs a very particular time in my life because recently, close to the November‚Äôs Full Moon, a new cycle of my life has begun. It was not something that I expected, and it hit me suddenly without any notice, during the last night in Lisbon, before coming back to the Azores. This new cycle is about manifesting dreams.I‚Äôve spent the last few years learning the ropes of entrepreneurship, and it was a tough fucking ride. I really loved the freedom of traveling whenever I want, working for myself and doing something I like doing, but there was also a darker side which manifested in different ways ‚Äì perfectionism, procrastination, stuckness, feeling of lacking, confusion, frustration, disappointment, disillusionment. I‚Äôve learnt a lot through that process, and to be honest with you, I had a total blast, despite the challenges. Plus I got to travel to some amazing places. Japan, which I absolutely adored. Thailand, which changed me deeply. Edinburgh, which I revisited for a short while and experienced the contrast between my new and the old self who used to live there for seven years. I feel like Edinburgh will always be a very special place for me. A lot of the processes which are happening now started there, many years ago. Ah, and I also spent some time housesitting, which was a wonderful opportunity to stay in some exciting homes, but primarily, to connect with animals on a deeper level. Btw, around an hour ago, a cat that lives with me, Kiki, was defending the house from some forest creature, with continuous loud meowing, growling and hissing. It was kinda scary and hilarious at the same time. She‚Äôs quite a character. I guess all cats are.Let me tell you about Dreams.I‚Äôve spent this summer living in a forest, with a dear friend as a neighbour. She‚Äôs a Lithuanian forest witch and a beautiful soul. Being in between the trees right on the ocean cliff was a special moment in space and time. I was sinking into the forest floor every night and felt a growing awareness of what I refer to now as intuition ‚Äì a feeling of what is the next action to take, that is the most beneficial for All. I‚Äôve been tuning myself more and more to it, and whenever I can reach this deep connected state, magical things happen.And then I went from the forest, into the city. I didn‚Äôt feel like leaving from Pico and the Forest, but I broke my front tooth earlier in May, and decided not to be a pirate for life (at least visually speaking) and replace it with a fake one, which was a complicated procedure requiring two trips to the mainland, one in June, one in September. June was the first time I was back in a city environment after over a year in an island without a single traffic light. It was shocking, especially with all the Fear creeping everywhere. And yet, I spent a lot of time dancing in public spaces, being free, and bringing a sense of hope and joy to random people who noticed me around. But I couldn‚Äôt wait to come back to Pico.The trip in September was the most powerful journey in my life so far. After Being in the forest, I‚Äôve been so tuned into myself, that I sunk into a deep meditative state for three weeks. It didn‚Äôt last the whole time of course, but a big chunk of it. I spent most of my waking hours walking. I would wake up, prepare cacao, have some food, and walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk for hours and hours. I often listened to Tibetan gongs as I walked, which kept me grounded and aware. I‚Äôve spent three weeks, going back and forth (by train) between Porto, where my dental appointments were, and Lisbon, where I wanted to be on all the days in between. And then walk and walk and walk in these two cities.As I kept walking, I opened myself to something. I‚Äôve never experienced such an overwhelming amount of synchronicities, beautiful encounters with strangers, and moments of connection. I know that this tends to happen during travels, but this was a whole new level of abundance. I felt touched deeply, noticed numerous patterns in myself which I wasn‚Äôt aware of, and experienced some insights which reframed how I am and want to be in the world.The final part of the trip was holding a wedding ceremony for my dear friend, who didn‚Äôt want to get married in a church, and asked me to perform the ceremony. It was magical. I‚Äôd love to do more of these in the future. If you know of someone who wants to celebrate their love, whether it‚Äôs a romantic relationship or a friendship, with a beautiful ceremony, I‚Äôm available.Shortly after the wedding I went back to Pico, to co-host a community gathering. This is actually worth a quick intermission in between travel stories. My arrival to Pico coincided with coming across a community building framework called microsolidarity. It resonated with me a lot, and I thought ‚Äì hey, let‚Äôs do it in Pico and see what happens. Well‚Ä¶ A year later, we‚Äôve had two gatherings, have a few community projects going, and a few more sprouting over the surface. I feel like I have family in the island, and I have a feeling I‚Äôm not the only person who feels this way. And I‚Äôve taken a role of catalyst and documenter of this community and I‚Äôm really enjoying the process. A big dream for this lifecycle is to co-create Azores Regenerative Network, and travel between the nine islands on a sailboat and catalyse local community projects.So‚Ä¶ I arrive back to Pico, getting ready to host the gathering, and I have this feeling that I need to come back to the Mainland. There‚Äôs something awaiting me there. I kinda waited for an excuse and a few days later I‚Äôve seen an invite to a tree-planting gathering in a part of continental Portugal called Alentejo, so I booked my flights for right after the Pico gathering. From one to another‚Ä¶There was a good reason though.Being in the mainland again, and it really felt like a continuation of the previous trip, but with a different flavour, made some things very clear to me:1) There is a growing amount of people already living in a different culture. By different, I mean not part of the mess of a mainstream capitalist system that‚Äôs eating our souls and the planet. The alternative is not very clearly defined, because we‚Äôre all experimenting, and it takes time, but it‚Äôs based on love, openness, connection, living close to the land, regenerating‚Ä¶ We feel it intuitively. It kinda makes sense that this is growing, considering the hyper pumping of fear in the last few years, and the fact that light requires darkness and vice versa. But it also makes my heart smile. The alternative we‚Äôre creating is just so much more appealing, that it‚Äôs just a matter of time. Of course, there will be some challenges and times of darkness during that time, but all we need to do is shine. The big shift has happened. I was writing about it in my recent Moonly Review, which is a practice that I do for a year now and really enjoy ‚Äì every üåë and üåï I write about what‚Äôs been alive in me in this cycle and publish it. It keeps me accountable and hopefully brings some good vibes to a few people who read it. I really enjoy writing and publishing my words. I‚Äôm now experimenting with reading my letters out loud, but it‚Äôs still something very new.2) My entrepreneurial journey disconnected me a bit from my big dreams. They were still there, but hidden, barely noticeable. It was necessary though, so I can learn how to overcome the challenges I mentioned earlier. But after encountering people who have Big, beautiful dreams and actually manifest a lot of them, I can‚Äôt help but notice that so can I. I‚Äôm not special in that sense, anyone can. It‚Äôs just the matter of finding a way.So, the Dreams.I‚Äôm reconnecting with the practice of writing letters, and I‚Äôd love to do it as a lifestyle. Ideally combined with walking, of course.I‚Äôm catalysing a beautiful community in Pico, and soon beginning my work in the neighbouring islands, as I move towards co-creating an archipelago-wide network. I‚Äôm in the process of making this my paid work, which would be a bliss, although I‚Äôd do it anyway.I‚Äôm living in a tiny house, which is not mine, but it‚Äôs a perfect opportunity to prototype my ideal living scenario ‚Äì a tiny house in the middle of an agroforest, with good friends as neighbours within a walking distance. All I need is to find the land, which is already in the process.I feel called to Brazil, so I‚Äôm co-creating a sailing trip for the next season (Nov/Dec 2022). I met some amazing people in my recent travels and it seems that we can make it happen. It‚Äôs not just about the trip, but also about promoting a different mode of travel ‚Äì slower, rather than faster, and using the time in between for deep personal and relational growth that can benefit the world.There‚Äôs still some blockage around my online journaling business, but I‚Äôm getting more clarity on that ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to keep creating journaling games that help people reconnect with themselves regularly, making it easier to stay aligned and embody their values no matter the challenges that life throws at them.I also dream of a beautiful world where all beings can thrive, and I guess, these are my tiny little roles to play in making it possible.Dreaming is easy though. The challenge is to manifest the dreams.But I feel that in this cycle it is all possible.Let‚Äôs see what happens.‚Ä¶That‚Äôs a bit about what‚Äôs going on in my life right now.Tell me what‚Äôs your world been and is like and what are the Dreams you‚Äôre manifesting!Sending a big hug from the forest üå≥.Micha≈Ç",

            "content_text": "What you‚Äôre about to read could use three sentences of context.I felt stuck with the direction for JournalSmarter, so I decided to write a letter to it. I‚Äôve been recently reconnecting with writing letters, which is one of my favourite things to do. I hope that what this one helps to create will bring you as much joy as it does to me as I finish writing these words of introduction, after reading the whole letter you‚Äôre about to read.Micha≈ÇüìñüéâThe Cabin, 8 December 2021Dear JournalSmarter,It‚Äôs your third birthday, if I remember correctly, and I felt that it is a perfect opportunity to write you a letter. I don‚Äôt think I ever wrote to a brand, but strangely it doesn‚Äôt feel weird at all. Let‚Äôs see what happens.I‚Äôm writing to you because I‚Äôm struggling to figure out what do you want to be. Since I‚Äôm one of your parents, I feel responsible to equip you with everything you need to unfold your wings and fly. I‚Äôm totally in your corner. In fact, I‚Äôm deeply linked with you and you‚Äôll always be a part of my identity, even if our paths might separate one day.I was actually pondering today, as I was walking in my favourite part of the Island, if we should part. It was a precious realisation that we indeed can.  I‚Äôm not enslaved by you in any way. In fact, I choose to give my energy to you and continue on this path, at least for now.But, I admit, I‚Äôm confused about what‚Äôs next.Are you?I‚Äôd really love to connect with you and feel into what do you want. I know that it‚Äôs not just about me, and in fact, the best results are the co-created ones.So‚Ä¶ Would you like to share?‚Ä¶Well‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs unexpected question to answer. I guess‚Ä¶ No, I feel that the name doesn‚Äôt resonate with me very much. It‚Äôs a good, solid name, but it doesn‚Äôt represent accurately what I want to be, which is intuitive journaling. Intuition over mind. Being connected instead of being smart. You get my drift? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with smartness, but you know very well that mind plays tricks, and often disconnects you from what your heart knows.‚Ä¶I see your point. The word ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù has been important for me lately, and intuition is definitely something I‚Äôd like to explore more. And I mean it, not as just yet another thing I say I‚Äôd like to do. This is for real.And journaling plays an important role in that process.In fact, it‚Äôs one of the most effective practices that I do consistently that reconnect me with myself and therefore my intuition. My journal is something I always carry with me. Seriously, people laugh at me, that I always carry my backpack, but I just don‚Äôt want to leave my journal behind wherever I go. It‚Äôs a physical reminder that I can always access any part of myself. Of course, I don‚Äôt really need my journal for that, but it‚Äôs a gateway that makes it much, much easier.‚Ä¶That makes sense. Now, imagine what the world could be like if a lot of people would act from a place of being grounded, aligned and connected with themselves. Whenever you‚Äôre grounded you can face any challenge with peace and kindness. You can stay clear on your path and don‚Äôt get distracted. You can sense-make your experience and filter signal from noise, and consciously decide what to do with it.In a nutshell, being connected with yourself is a powerful state and it shapes whatever it is that you‚Äôre creating with your life. What you do matters, but who you are matters too. Journaling is a daily check, showing you who you really are, on an ongoing basis, which is a precious gift.Do you know why?‚Ä¶Awareness informs action. I‚Äôve experienced that numerous times when connecting with myself on the pages of my journal. But I‚Äôd like to focus our conversation on what you want to become.I feel that you have something more specific to share on that. I‚Äôd really love to hear it!‚Ä¶I‚Äôll get there, but first, an unexpected curve ball.I know that you like documenting the process of making beautiful ideas happen. That‚Äôs essentially a form of public journaling. You log your process, sense-make your experience, and share it with the world. And people appreciate that, because what you are documenting is important to be documented.It‚Äôs not about the format, it‚Äôs about what the format allows.Journaling is a format for self-connection. For cultivating deep self-awareness. For sense-making. For constantly becoming a beautiful person.There are thousand ways, or specific formats if you‚Äôd like, for how this can be done, and this is your freaking superpower ‚Äì you can turn anything into a journaling practice and share it in a clear and actionable way that‚Äôs fun to do. You‚Äôre creating games. Journaling Games. That‚Äôs a good name, by the way, keep a note of it, but don‚Äôt get too attached, okay? It‚Äôs not about the freaking name. It‚Äôs about what journaling allows ‚Äì¬†realigning daily and moving forward on the path no matter the challenge.Now, here‚Äôs another important component, so pay attention ‚Äì this process can benefit anyone, but you‚Äôve learned the hard way that in the digital world this doesn‚Äôt work. But it‚Äôs not just about for specific target audience you define through some marketing framework, but about people who resonate with the vibe you are creating.Let me tell you about my vibe.It‚Äôs a vibe of play. Kindness. Making the world a better place, starting today and continuing tomorrow. It‚Äôs a vibe of joy and appreciating life for the beauty the world showers us with everyday. It‚Äôs a vibe of encouragement to keep going, especially when it‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs about encouraging people to shine. You know how to do this. You are already doing it. You always were. So why do you feel so stuck? Because, here‚Äôs the punch ‚Äì¬†you actually aren‚Äôt.‚Ä¶Hmm‚Ä¶ Thank you for saying that. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it, but then again, I wasn‚Äôt expecting to write a letter to a brand I‚Äôve created. I feel like laughing for a bit, so I will, I hope that‚Äôs okay.In fact I‚Äôll take a moment to move my body a little bit, because I really need it. It‚Äôs beautiful to notice that as I write this I‚Äôm becoming more and more connected with myself. Thank you for that. That‚Äôs the magic of writing letters.(He dances.)It‚Äôs funny.Whenever I start dancing good things happen.I feel much, much clearer on what is your vision for yourself.A playful reminder to journal.An inspiring guide showing not only what you can do with your journal (so you are excited about it), but also what is the magic that happens when you stay connected with yourself, which journaling helps you do regularly.A community of people encouraging each other to co-create a beautiful world where all beings can thrive, with a funky, creative, loving, and playful flavour.An infinite game worth playing and inviting others to play.The rest is figuring out some technical details of how to set it all up. Luckily, I‚Äôm going to talk to someone who can help me with this tomorrow. How wonderful.I guess that concludes my letter to you.Happy Birthday, JournalSmarter!üìñ‚ú®",

            "summary": "From lonely nomad to community catalyst",
            "content_text": "Let‚Äôs begin with a bit of context:I‚Äôve been location independent from 2017 and I absolutely love the freedom of being able to move whenever I feel it‚Äôs the right time to do it. There is however a price to pay for that freedom: the pain of saying goodbye to people dear to your heart, knowing that you might never see them again. Life is unpredictable.I admit, that even if I traveled with a partner, there were times during my travels when I felt quite lonely. I did encounter many wonderful Souls, and the connections were intense but also short. I lacked continuity.One day I decided to make a list of people I intuitively felt like reaching out to. Some were close friends, and others were people I shared a single powerful moment sometime, somewhere. The following day I sent them all a message.Some people replied and we had a call, others replied and that was it. Some never replied at all. I considered it a ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù. There‚Äôs time and space for each connection. No hard feelings. With some people however I felt a clear ‚Äúconnection match‚Äù and some developed into beautiful friendships.The next step was to experiment with different frequencies for calls. I found that different intervals work better for each relationship ‚Äì the rarer the call, the more ‚Äúmacro‚Äù the perspective. With some people it feels more natural to stay close to each other and reflect together on things that are alive right now, and with others it feels wonderful to look together at an entire year of our lives and share whatever comes up to the surface.In the process, I also discovered that I generally prefer audio-only calls. Video is nice, but I‚Äôd rather go for a walk rather than stare at a computer screen. With time, I gravitated towards async connections, such as long voice-notes, emails and letters.In a few months, I eradicated the feeling of loneliness, and nurtured myself with recurring 1:1 conversations with people I love.Microsolidarity ExperimentsDiscovering microsolidarity in the beginning of 2020 was a huge milestone for me.Microsolidarity gave me vocabulary to operate with and served as a practical guide to weaving wonderful social interactions at a bigger scale, with a possibility of changing the world together.Three ideas really struck a deeper chord:1) People before projects ‚Äì&gt; start with finding the people that you can co-create magic with2) Different group sizes serve different purposes ‚Äì&gt; large groups serve as a ‚Äúdating pool‚Äù to find your small groups where the magic happens3) Verbs &gt; Nouns ‚Äì&gt; theory is useful, but focus on the practiceI sat down and made another list.I let the names sink in for some time, feeling into small groups that would make sense to call into existence. When it felt right, I reached out to some people with an idea of launching ‚Äúmastermind groups‚Äù (which was the vocabulary more familiar to the people I was reaching out to).Here‚Äôs a part of an email exchange with one of the people I reached out to, introducing the idea of co-creating a group.Over the next few months I launched a few crews:  The Unicorns ü¶Ñ - digital, 4 people (2 couples), mutual support, March 2020 - January 2021  Team Angie ‚ö°Ô∏è - digital, 4 people, exploring different topics related to emotional development, May 2020 - May 2021  Loverz Powerz üíú - digital, 4 people (2 couples), relationship-focused, May 2020 - May 2021  Routine Bootcamp üöÄ - digital, 3 people, building routines together based on Metagame Mastermind Format (youtube video), June - November 2020  The Circle ‚ö™Ô∏è - presential, 4 housemates, weekly sharing circle followed by a co-living talk, February - June 2020  Pico Sharing Circle üåÄ - presential, ~10 people, bi-weekly sharing circle, which eventually grew into an entire congregation. Here‚Äôs the documentation of the circle.A few reflections:  While I took the responsibility of being the caller (the person who calls the pod to existence), I deliberately let go of my default facilitating posture and practiced co-creating together. The crews usually started with one or two ‚Äúmeta calls‚Äù diving into our intentions and deciding how do we want to be together, including technicalities such as rhythm, format etc.  Crews had a timeframe agreed in advance. Each cycle was closed with a retrospective when we decided what‚Äôs the next step, for example closing the crew or beginning another cycle.  Even if we committed to the schedule set up in advance, there was always at least one call that we had to skip due to life being life (na-na-na-na-na). Pods tended to work better with meetings no further than one month apart.  Keeping a recording was kinda useless, but we all enjoyed sharing our notes with each other  I kept a log of each pod for learning purposes. I‚Äôm very grateful that I did, because I‚Äôm looking at them as I write this article.  I loved the process of coming up with the crew name together.üëÅ Key Insight:Start your microsolidarity journey by calling a crew (or a couple of them). Today is a perfect day to do it. You‚Äôll learn all the skills you need along the way, and who knows - your crew(s) might eventually grow into a congregation.Check out the resources at the end of this article if you need some extra help.EnspiralIn September 2021 I joined Enspiral, a network of people helping each other do more meaningful work. The network design includes pods (equivalent to crews in microslidarity lingo) to support building relationships within the network. While I haven‚Äôt joined any pods, mostly due to all the other crews I had going on at the time, I got involved in Enspiral Europe Connection Working Group hosting bi-weekly Connection Calls for Enspiralites based in Europe.  Create documentation of the formats tried in EECC to publish in the Enspiral Handbook.Growing a congregation in Pico IslandWhat happened in Pico surpassed my wildest dreams.In a bit over one year since our very first sharing circle, we hosted two community gatherings, launch numerous projects, and created a strong foundation for a thriving congregation.The most surprising part is that it was actually quite simple. I called a sharing circle, and as people started to spend time getting to know each other on a deeper level, magic started to happen.

            "content_html": "<p>Let‚Äôs begin with a bit of context:</p><p>I‚Äôve been location independent from 2017 and I absolutely love the freedom of being able to move whenever I feel it‚Äôs the right time to do it. There is however a price to pay for that freedom: <strong>the pain of saying goodbye to people dear to your heart, knowing that you might never see them again</strong>. Life is unpredictable.</p><p>I admit, that even if I traveled with a partner, there were times during my travels when I felt quite lonely. I did encounter many wonderful Souls, and the connections were intense but also short. I lacked continuity.</p><p>One day <strong>I decided to make a list of people I intuitively felt like reaching out to</strong>. Some were close friends, and others were people I shared a single powerful moment sometime, somewhere. The following day I sent them all a message.</p><p>Some people replied and we had a call, others replied and that was it. Some never replied at all. I considered it a ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù. <strong>There‚Äôs time and space for each connection</strong>. No hard feelings. With some people however I felt a clear ‚Äúconnection match‚Äù and some developed into beautiful friendships.</p><p>The next step was to <strong>experiment with different frequencies for calls</strong>. I found that different intervals work better for each relationship ‚Äì the rarer the call, the more ‚Äúmacro‚Äù the perspective. With some people it feels more natural to stay close to each other and reflect together on things that are alive right now, and with others it feels wonderful to look together at an entire year of our lives and share whatever comes up to the surface.</p><p>In the process, I also discovered that <strong>I generally prefer audio-only calls</strong>. Video is nice, but I‚Äôd rather go for a walk rather than stare at a computer screen. With time, I gravitated towards async connections, such as long voice-notes, emails and letters.</p><p>In a few months, I eradicated the feeling of loneliness, and nurtured myself with recurring 1:1 conversations with people I love.</p><h2 id=\"microsolidarity-experiments\">Microsolidarity Experiments</h2><p>Discovering <a href=\"https://microsolidarity.cc\" target=\"_blank\">microsolidarity</a> in the beginning of 2020 was a huge milestone for me.</p><p><strong>Microsolidarity gave me vocabulary to operate with and served as a practical guide to weaving wonderful social interactions at a bigger scale, with a possibility of changing the world together.</strong></p><p>Three ideas really struck a deeper chord:</p><p>1) <strong>People before projects</strong> ‚Äì&gt; start with finding the people that you can co-create magic with<br />2) <strong>Different group sizes serve different purposes</strong> ‚Äì&gt; large groups serve as a ‚Äúdating pool‚Äù to find your small groups where the magic happens<br />3) <strong>Verbs &gt; Nouns</strong> ‚Äì&gt; theory is useful, but focus on the practice</p><p>I sat down and made another list.</p><p><img src=\"assets/who-are-the-people.jpg\" alt=\"Who Are The People?\" /></p><p>I let the names sink in for some time, feeling into small groups that would make sense to call into existence. When it felt right, I reached out to some people with an idea of launching ‚Äúmastermind groups‚Äù (which was the vocabulary more familiar to the people I was reaching out to).</p><p>Here‚Äôs a part of an email exchange with one of the people I reached out to, introducing the idea of co-creating a group.</p><p><img src=\"assets/crew-invitation-email.png\" alt=\"Crew Invitation Email Screenshot\" /></p><p>Over the next few months I launched a few crews:</p><ul>  <li><strong>The Unicorns</strong> ü¶Ñ - digital, 4 people (2 couples), mutual support, March 2020 - January 2021</li>  <li><strong>Team Angie</strong> ‚ö°Ô∏è - digital, 4 people, exploring different topics related to emotional development, May 2020 - May 2021</li>  <li><strong>Loverz Powerz</strong> üíú - digital, 4 people (2 couples), relationship-focused, May 2020 - May 2021</li>  <li><strong>Routine Bootcamp</strong> üöÄ - digital, 3 people, building routines together based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDWuHsyznf4\" target=\"_blank\">Metagame Mastermind Format (youtube video)</a>, June - November 2020</li>  <li><strong>The Circle</strong> ‚ö™Ô∏è - presential, 4 housemates, weekly sharing circle followed by a co-living talk, February - June 2020</li>  <li><strong>Pico Sharing Circle</strong> üåÄ - presential, ~10 people, bi-weekly sharing circle, which eventually grew into an entire congregation.

Each cycle was closed with a retrospective</strong> when we decided what‚Äôs the next step, for example closing the crew or beginning another cycle.</li>  <li>Even if we committed to the schedule set up in advance, there was always at least one call that we had to skip due to life being life (na-na-na-na-na). Pods tended to work better with meetings no further than one month apart.</li>  <li>Keeping a recording was kinda useless, but we all enjoyed sharing our notes with each other</li>  <li><strong>I kept a log of each pod for learning purposes</strong>.

            "content_text": "27 November 2021 üåóDear Santa,I am in a privileged position of my basic monthly expenses being more or less covered by my online business, at least for now.It wasn‚Äôt easy to get here.It took four years of being constantly challenged by the entrepreneurial learning curve. One of the biggest difficulties revolves around money. In a nutshell: I feel very little alignment with the current capitalist system and I‚Äôd like to embody a different paradigm.But that isn‚Äôt easy when I depend on my own business to bring income. On one hand I am fully committed to release products that genuinely enrich lives and contribute to co-creating a beautiful planet where all beings can thrive. On the other, I feel pressure to make enough to pay the basic expenses. With the entrepreneurial world saturated with content prioritizing making more money rather than why and how aligned, it‚Äôs been hard to stay grounded and maintain a relatively steady course aligned with what my heart believes in.But it‚Äôs been kinda working lately, and I feel that my work is tuning in more and more with my values, while bringing in enough financially to sustain my basic needs, and leaving more time and energy to give freely to work that matters that I don‚Äôt want to charge for within the capitalist economy.Because, I deeply believe that not everything should be monetized.Regenerating the land.Healing oneself and others.Sharing the Light to inspire and encourage more people to enter into the upwards spiral of the beautiful world that our hearts know is possible 1.These are my priorities, and while I‚Äôm committed to this path anyway, I could certainly use your help. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this letter to ask you for a Gift.As a minimalist on a constant journey to have less items and more space, I learned that offering a gift is a beautiful but challenging art. For example, for a long time my family kept giving me stuff, which while being given from the heart and therefore appreciated, was, generally speaking, useless for me and only created unnecessary clutter.What I learned through this process is:a) experiences generally make much better gifts for me.b) it is my responsibility to communicate clearly which gifts are the most aligned with what my heart points me towards right now, instead of expecting another person to know that intuitively.This letter is an externalisation of these two lessons in a form of a public wishlist, supported by a firm belief that there is plenty of abundance of different sorts all around, and that within the Gift Economy (which we are indeed all a part of) the gifts gravitate towards the place where they are needed most.I‚Äôm not saying that the items on my list are universally speaking the biggest voids in the universe waiting to be filled. I already have all that I need. However, it is possible that you are in a position to fill these voids for me, and thus make a real positive impact in my life, and, through ripple effect, the lives of others.Whether that‚Äôs the case or not, I‚Äôm grateful for your presence, and I wish you wonderful Winter Holidays, whichever and whenever you choose to celebrate.With Love and Gratitude,Micha≈Ç.ps. The List:Education  Permaculture Design Course, residential in Portugal (or even better, in Azores) or online, because I believe that permaculture is one of the most important fields to study right now, and I have pretty much zero experience with it.

            "content_html": "<p>27 November 2021 üåó</p><h2 id=\"dear-santa\">Dear Santa,</h2><p>I am in a privileged position of my basic monthly expenses being more or less covered by my online business, at least for now.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt easy to get here.</p><p>It took four years of being constantly challenged by the entrepreneurial learning curve. One of the biggest difficulties revolves around money. In a nutshell: <strong>I feel very little alignment with the current capitalist system and I‚Äôd like to embody a different paradigm.</strong></p><p>But that isn‚Äôt easy when I depend on my own business to bring income. On one hand I am fully committed to release products that genuinely enrich lives and contribute to co-creating a beautiful planet where all beings can thrive. On the other, I feel pressure to make enough to pay the basic expenses. With the entrepreneurial world saturated with content prioritizing making more money rather than <em>why</em> and <em>how aligned</em>, it‚Äôs been hard to stay grounded and maintain a relatively steady course aligned with what my heart believes in.</p><p>But it‚Äôs been kinda working lately, and I feel that my work is tuning in more and more with my values, while bringing in enough financially to sustain my basic needs, and leaving more time and energy to <em>give freely</em> to work that matters that I don‚Äôt want to charge for within the capitalist economy.</p><p>Because, I deeply believe that <strong>not everything should be monetized</strong>.</p><p>Regenerating the land.</p><p>Healing oneself and others.</p><p>Sharing the Light to inspire and encourage more people to enter into the upwards spiral of the beautiful world that our hearts know is possible <sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p><p>These are my priorities, and while I‚Äôm committed to this path anyway, I could certainly use your help. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this letter to ask you for a Gift.</p><p>As a minimalist on a constant journey to have less items and more space, I learned that offering a gift is a beautiful but challenging art. For example, for a long time my family kept giving me stuff, which while being given from the heart and therefore appreciated, was, generally speaking, useless for me and only created unnecessary clutter.</p><p>What I learned through this process is:</p><p>a) experiences generally make much better gifts for me.</p><p>b) it is my responsibility to communicate clearly which gifts are the most aligned with what my heart points me towards right now, instead of expecting another person to know that intuitively.</p><p>This letter is an externalisation of these two lessons in a form of a public wishlist, supported by a firm belief that there is plenty of abundance of different sorts all around, and that within the Gift Economy (which we are indeed all a part of) the gifts gravitate towards the place where they are needed most.</p><p>I‚Äôm not saying that the items on my list are <em>universally speaking</em> the biggest voids in the universe waiting to be filled. <strong>I already have all that I need.</strong> However, it is possible that you are in a position to fill these voids for me, and thus make a real positive impact in my life, and, through ripple effect, the lives of others.</p><p>Whether that‚Äôs the case or not, I‚Äôm grateful for your presence, and I wish you wonderful Winter Holidays, whichever and whenever you choose to celebrate.</p><p>With Love and Gratitude,<br />Micha≈Ç.</p><p>ps.

It‚Äôs a combination of items that tells a lot about me.As I‚Äôm waiting for the airline to call me to arrange the drop-off of my backpack which arrived to Faial just in time to get the 1415 ferry to Pico (which I‚Äôm writing down with the intention of manifesting it into reality), I get to practice letting go. Of course, my stuff doesn‚Äôt matter, but I do feel attached to the combination of items I have carefully assembled over the last few years of scaling down. It‚Äôd be a bitch to replace a few of them, and also, quite a lot of money ‚Äì¬†a resource that is quite scarce in my life. While certainly inconvenient, I do trust that my backpack is already on it‚Äôs way back to me, and even if it isn‚Äôt, I know that it‚Äôs just stuff ‚Äì¬†even if precious to me.What matters is the experience of Being in the Mainland, and all the processes, internal and external, that happened during this journey, and, as well, the processes that are about to begin because of this journey. Because it does indeed feel like the beginning of another cycle. I can feel that something deep has shifted within me, something cracked and opened, some subconscious pattern (or patterns) were overwritten.If this is the beginning though, I feel that it‚Äôs worth inquiring ‚Äúof what?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know that yet, but if I‚Äôd have to look for some words, I‚Äôd lean into letting go of fears holding me back, dreaming big, and manifesting these dreams into reality with an open heart shining with light.

That‚Äôs the hard part.</p><p>Oppressing, repressing, suppressing, pretending it‚Äôs not there, numbing, distracting, and other clever strategies can work in the short run, but ultimately Fear awaits to be acknowledged head on and embraced, like any other being on this planet.</p><p>Once accepted, it looses it‚Äôs paralyzing power. allowing for a deep wholehearted hug.</p><p>With the heart truly open, no Fear can be.</p>",

It‚Äôs been a while.But here it gets interesting:The life, a curious mistress, teaches me that I both can and can‚Äôt have what I want, which while being a profound guidance is also some fucking conflicting advice.To elaborate:In one moment I connect to the infinite cosmic reality, the ‚ÄúBig We‚Äù, as my friend calls it, and manifest any reality I choose, provided I‚Äôm specific enough to verbalize it and put it out there into the Universe, ideally out loud while facing one of the raw elements in the time when specific celestial bodies align. But to be fair, any space can become sacred if only treated with appropriate reverence.The flow is a blessed state to be in for sure, and yet, it tends to end abruptly without notice, leaving me confused, disconnected, and lonely. Still waiting for the magical girl to appear, caress my back without warning, look deeply at me, and deliberately kiss my neck slowly to see what happens.I can feel the shivers. But, whether I like it or not, it is not the reality, at least not in this very moment. Feel free to prove me wrong though.As I sit with myself, unfolding knots tangled over the light shining from within, I feel, yet again, the conflicting advice of the Universe and it‚Äôs teachers.I could remain still, witnessing my feelings arise and pass away in the infinite flow of impermanence, both blissful and difficult to accept, especially at times when the conscious choice of letting go is particularly hard. I know you‚Äôve been there.I could also act upon this very moment, and instead of waiting for the magic to happen, create the magic myself, with a not-so-litte help of the Universe, provided it‚Äôs a day when Good Fortune smiles at my cute attempts of seducing a powerful woman.It‚Äôs difficult, because as I sit still with this process happening inside of me, and become conscious of it as I write it down, and now, although it‚Äôs a very scary thought, sharing it out loud with you, I feel that I‚Äôm growing inside, slowly, awkwardly, and with a fair degree of metaphysical pain, but ultimately becoming a person that is more aware and therefore loving.This process of growth feels important to go through, so that‚Äôs probably why I am still here, right in the middle of this mess of myself, dying along with my unfulfilled desires, and reviving along with another moment given to me to experience.What a gift to be able to live this very conflict. To Be, still and motionless, witnessing what is and Being with it‚Ä¶ or not.This power of deliberately changing my mindset gives me shivers, too.I‚Äôm still here, making space for the magical girl to touch my soul and body and help me heal, but I‚Äôm not waiting.I‚Äôm actively Being.And just like that, as I let go of my expectations and fully accept this moment, the magic happens.The girl doesn‚Äôt appear, but my soul is touched by something strong and I can feel the knots loosening allowing me to breathe deeper and smile wholeheartedly.It‚Äôs a precious moment, and I‚Äôm grateful to Vaclav Havel for providing me with this table in a park so I could live through it and share the tale with you.",

It rips our hearts, as we fall in love with people, places, things, parts of our skin and memories‚Äìwhich all inevitably change.Everything is temporary and here I am about to leave you.I‚Äôm moving to another chapter of life to discover who I am, what the world is and what there is in this world.I‚Äôm going to discover geographical locations and people who live there and how they live and how they build connections between themselves. I‚Äôll observe and learn how I can help and appreciate the differences between us.I am genuinely interested in people and the world, because it is all so curious to me. How could you not be interested in the world which is so full of life and so full of beautiful things? The world with the sea, which is so vast and goes from one side to another one and then comes back to surround it all! The world where you look up and suddenly there is a whole sky above with the universe and the planets and the universes beyond the universes we can barely begin to imagine.Everything is one. It‚Äôs just life. Life‚Äìwhich I perceive through the lens of me. I need to learn about what makes me me, so I can make good use of time, which I have so abundantly received. I need to study myself to learn about the world without alien filters.Time to stand up and stretch my back. Time to move on.Thank you for the time we have spent together.Thank you for showing me everything that makes you you.üåÄSince this was originally an audio recording, I‚Äôve used parts of this letter to narrate the video diary I created in this powerful time of transition.

We don‚Äôt look up often enough.</p><p>Goodbyes are never easy and you‚Äôve been a wonderful company for the past seven years. Enough to feel you are my home. It‚Äôs with you that I became who I am now.</p><p>Before knowing you I was unconscious.</p><p>Before knowing you, I was conscious only of self-consciousness, as a teenage boy falling in love with beautiful girls who weren‚Äôt falling back in love with me‚Äìwhich I couldn‚Äôt understand, because I would give them all of myself.</p><p>Love is a hard process to learn. It rips our hearts, as we fall in love with people, places, things, parts of our skin and memories‚Äìwhich all inevitably change.</p><p><em>Everything is temporary and here I am about to leave you.</em></p><p>I‚Äôm moving to another chapter of life to discover who I am, what the world is and what there is in this world.</p><p>I‚Äôm going to discover geographical locations and people who live there and how they live and how they build connections between themselves. I‚Äôll observe and learn how I can help and appreciate the differences between us.</p><p>I am genuinely interested in people and the world, because it is all so curious to me. How could you not be interested in the world which is so full of life and so full of beautiful things? The world with the sea, which is so vast and goes from one side to another one and then comes back to surround it all! The world where you look up and suddenly there is a whole sky above with the universe and the planets and the universes beyond the universes we can barely begin to imagine.</p><p>Everything is one. It‚Äôs just life. Life‚Äìwhich I perceive through the lens of me. I need to learn about what makes me me, so I can make good use of time, which I have so abundantly received. I need to study myself to learn about the world without alien filters.</p><p>Time to stand up and stretch my back. Time to move on.</p><p><em>Thank you for the time we have spent together.</em></p><p><em>Thank you for showing me everything that makes you you.</em></p><p>üåÄ</p><p>Since this was originally an audio recording, I‚Äôve used parts of this letter to narrate the video diary I created in this powerful time of transition. It is one of these few pieces of myself that I revisit every now and then, and it puts me in a beautifully emotional state.

            "content_text": "Back in February 2024 I reached out to Daneel and Ani with a proposal to test our collaboration. Eight months later we concluded a month long mastermind bringing together 14 people to write the first book about semi-nomadism, build friendships, and create a community driven publishing studio.TLDR: The book is now done and the mastermind worked so well that we‚Äôre having another one in April 2025 (more info at the end).Here‚Äôs the retrospective from the mastermind starting with a 55 seconds video:   (click this link if the video doesn‚Äôt load.)Why Spend A Month Co-Writing A Book?Brining people for long enough in-real-life spaces to create something together is my ikigai.Allow me to dissect:1. Long EnoughRelationships grow at the speed of trust, and a few days is simply too short to go deep enough and ground the emerging connection with a solid foundation for a lasting friendship. Sure, you can amplify depth and bonding with facilitation tricks and make people feel super connected over a weekend, but the real good stuff takes time.Living together for a month feels like being a part of an established ecosystem. There are routines, rituals, ongoing conversations, and evolving building blocks of culture shaped together by a group. Most importantly - there‚Äôs plenty of time to get to know each other, while resting well, and continuously integrating the experience.üì∏ Taking time to explore the absolutely stunning nature, with hundreds of kilometers of hikes starting right at our doorstep.Speaking of continuous integration ‚Äì you‚Äôre quite unlikely to hit pause on everything else happening in your life for an entire month, which naturally weaves your inside-the-container experience with everything outside of it. There is no separation.2. In Real LifeYa, ya, enough zoom calls, thank you. IRL is more effective, more fun, more human. And hey, I‚Äôd choose being with you in person rather than on screen every time. And if we have an entire month together, then wow, I really can‚Äôt wait!üì∏ Exploring the space during one of the open space workshops.3. Creating TogetherThere‚Äôs nothing quite like getting to know a person through collaborating with them. Hanging out in an unstructured open space is fantastic, and yet, setting a direction of creating a tangible deliverable within the time time together is a game-changer. The delightful clash of ideas, communication styles, working approaches, personal focus areas, and fluctuating energy levels reveals potential matches for a long-term friendship and/or collaboration, and creates a feeling of a shared group identity anchored in the lived experience and in the physical artefact.In our case we wrote a freaking 190-page book in one month. It is a journey to remember and be proud of.  ‚ÄúI found belonging in ways I have not expected.‚Äù‚Äì SergeContainer DesignOur first book-writing prototype hosted at the Traditional Dream Factory in 2022 lasted 11 days and gathered 28 people. Together with my co-facilitator Daneel we prototyped everything from scratch in real time. Our energy was relentless. We finished the mastermind with a completed pdf of ‚ÄúHow To Build A Regenerative Village‚Äù and Treehouse DAO - an idea for a publisher. While the process worked well, we didn‚Äôt have enough space and capacity for tying loose ends, which resulted in two critical flaws:  We didn‚Äôt plan for editing and post-production.  We didn‚Äôt have clear agreements for decision making and financial flows.Womp womp.The result was a two year process to complete the last 5% needed to print the book. Learning from that experience, we reshaped the process completely, arriving at what seems to be a replicable month-long book writing container that kicks ass.Here‚Äôs how it works.How We Made A Book In 55 Hours üòé55 hours?We spent one month together but the actual book-making sessions lasted 3 hours x 5 days per week x 3 weeks = 45 hours total. Let‚Äôs add another 10 hours to account for the extra push on the last days and we‚Äôll get somewhere close to 55 hours for a 190-page book.THIS IS INSANE.Of course, sprinting for 55 hours straight wouldn‚Äôt work. To make it possible we needed to make time for creating group coherence, rest, subconscious processing and all the other good stuff on the community side of things.The result was the following plan:Week one focused on community weaving and creative foreplay.  We got to know each other  We made agreements on how we want to be together  We made Vermont Hub our home  We made agreements around copyrights and money flows  We established individual &amp; group routines  We introduced cards - our primary co-creation medium  We prompted subconscious processing for the table of contents  We hosted an open day inviting locals from Leysin which connected us to the local scene  We had an epic hikeüì∏ A few pieces of our culture puzzle.Something we haven‚Äôt planned was that many of us came to the mastermind with a personal sub-quest of stepping up their exercise routine. As a result most of us got a monthly pass to the local sport centre and started a daily mix of squash, swim, iceskating, archery and gym. Combined with the sauna we had at home, it kept our bodies in a fantastic shape throughout the month and provided a critical off-switch for the brainz üß†.üì∏ That delightful day when we did an archery class together.Week two is when we started to make pages.  We introduced the book-writing process  We crafted a short story  We created the table of contents  We created the first draft of the book - all with cards.üì∏ Sneak peek into our log containing the historical picture of the very first card played during the mastermindAt the end of week three we showcased the book to the public.  We introduced our upgraded collaborative writing OS in Figma (so damn sexy)  We digitalised, printed, and displayed pages on the wall, gallery style, and invited the locals to have a look and give us feedback  We hosted a digital event including a layer of engagement on polis and telegram  We opened pre-orders to fund the first print round  We designed the model for Tree House Collective - our community driven publishing studio  We had a well deserved party  We went for another epic hike!üì∏ It‚Äôs quite a sight to witness all of the pages printed for the first time.On a community-building note, week three became ‚Äúthe dating week‚Äù. The well-established group coherence naturally shifted the attention towards intentional 1:1s and deepening individual bonds. This is where long-term collaborations started to reveal themselves.üì∏ That‚Äôs a pic of a trio date, but you get the idea üòâ.Week four is when we finished the book. It was intense. The time pressure finally kicked in hard, both on completing the book and deepening the relationships.  We started with taking an extra day of rest (very needed)  We finalised the book in a hyperfocus mode  We had a great farewell party  We close the mastermind with a retrospectiveThat‚Äôs it. The book is done and available to order.The last step is the final day of rest and departures.üì∏ One of the best live feedback was the cuddle puddle after the closing ceremony resulting in falling asleep together. It warms my heart to witness such a degree of comfort and proximity.Zooming In On Daily RoutineOur working days started at 09h55 with a round of check-ins followed by Decentralised Needs Meeting and Open Space. We deliberately set the start time quite late to give people time to have an unrushed morning routine, breakfast, and for these early risers have some focused time for getting some personal work done.Decentralised Needs Meeting served as a space for anyone to express any need they might have without the pressure on the collective to meet the need. The objective is two-fold: a) practice verbalising needs b) increase chances of getting them met. After all, how can I know you need a massage if you keep it a secret?Open Space is a collective practice of coordinating activities for the day. Anyone could propose any activity to happen in any time outside of the 3 hour book making session.Here are a few examples to showcase the variety:  a trip to a local farm  contact improv  watching a film  intro to Ayurveda  intro to Enspiral  a workshop prototype around lessons we can learn from being at sea  and more‚Ä¶If you‚Äôre not familiar with Open Space, have a look here.üì∏ The delightful vibe of our morning moment together.After the moment of creating a daily group coherence and planning the day we jumped into 3 hours of book creation playtime (more on that later).Next, we‚Äôd float into lunch served by our amazing chef Josefina.üì∏ A food pic for your delight.Afternoon varied from day to day depending on open space offerings, but usually included a session of squash or other physical activity, before coming back together again for dinner prepped by daily rotating teams.Evenings depended on open space, and usually the day ended with someone turning on the sauna üî•. And then, half way through the mastermind, we discovered that sauna in the morning is an amazing way to start the day. We also discovered that quite a few of us were waking up very early which kickstarted our 5am/6am/7am club.üì∏ Here‚Äôs the boxes representing images to make. Our illustrator Tess is smashing it from the early morning üé®.That‚Äôs it for work days.On the first day of the weekend people tended to disappear into their own recharge modes. The house felt super quiet and cozy.üì∏ A well deserved moment of ultimate chill. Bonus points for the hat!On the second day the energy was back and we‚Äôd go for a hike, or just hang out in nature. This is also when many great creative ideas for the book sparked and we begun our famous balcony sessions.üì∏ The vibe is always excellent on the balcony.  ‚ÄúI could do these masterminds all of my life.‚Äú‚Äì AniZooming in on 3h Creative SprintsThe book was done in dedicated 3 hour sessions. No AI, just the limitless human creativity in flowstate with cards as a primary medium.The process goes through stages of free-flow brainstorming and sense-making, constrained by the format of book pages, which keeps the group focused and effective. In the meantime, our illustrator keeps on drawing.The speed is incredible. Our daily record was 51 pages!üì∏ The daily process of cardification.The most important part is, of course, the vibe. We are able to co-create so effectively because we‚Äôre in a constant state of play with the group quickly learning how to self-facilitate and adjust the process to match the energy in the room.The result is a beautiful illustrated book.  ‚ÄúIt was such a creative process. I‚Äôm proud to be behind this book!‚Äù*‚Äì YoavWhy Semi-Nomadism?I‚Äôve started this article with the process, because (in my opinion) the process makes 65% of the mastermind experience. On the other hand, the book is the focusing point for the month and the reason why we came together.We picked the topic of semi-nomadism because it feels relevant and fascinating to explore.The (digital) nomad lifestyle is by now quite well established in the global awareness, with a plenty of people living this way and plenty of resources and services catering to their needs. In the same time I keep noticing a growing need for stability and roots. I feel it myself - traveling is fantastic, but being constantly on the move doesn‚Äôt fulfil me anymore. I wish to have a base (or a few bases) to come back to, and see their growth over a longer period of time, while growing myself shaped by it. This mutual shaping - of a place by the person, and of a person by the place became a somewhat of a guiding definition for what a semi-nomad actually is.üì∏ Preview of the book pages.The word semi-nomad itself was fascinating to dissect.After all the prefix semi indicates being ‚Äúpartly something‚Äù, so being ‚Äúnot quite nomadic‚Äù. While accurate to a degree, we felt that it puts too much emphasis on the nomadic aspect, while the key piece of the puzzle for us was the aspect of having a home, or multiple homes.We explored alternative word choices (such as homad and rooted nomad), but in the end decided to stay with semi-nomad, as a good enough and safe enough. Our fired brains produced a wonderful poem though:üì∏ It was fun to read it out loud during dinner.If you have better words to describe the phenomena, you can contribute to the conversation on polis and telegram.The definition was one of many rabbit holes we embarked upon. The book is a snapshot of our collective exploration of the subject through multiple lenses, such as self, relationships, practical life-admin stuff (hooray tax and health insurance) and offers a collection of perspectives to consider when choosing to build a semi-nomadic lifestyle.Here are a few pages to look at:I mentioned already the feeling of shared identity stemming from creating a tangible deliverable together. I can‚Äôt wait to see the smile on authors faces when they will hold the physical print in their hands for the first time.There‚Äôs also something around the medium of a book itself that is particularly appealing. A book is a book. It is a format well recognised by both the mainstream and alternative pockets of cultural landscape and it carries a degree of seriousness and respectability that can transmit the ideas into the wider ecosystem.After all, we‚Äôre writing about topics within the wide ranging spectrum of regeneration, community and culture, with the intention of inspiring others to co-create a world where all beings can thrive.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving with more than just filled pages. I carry with me a renewed sense of my worth, a strength that comes from a community with shared alignment, and a desire to infuse more magic into every moment..‚Äù*‚Äì LucileOur Community Driven Publishing StudioTree House Collective is a community-driven publishing studio. By humans, for humans.We specialise in creating tangible deliverables and building friendships during In-Real-Life masterminds harnessing the power of play and creativity. Our books are co-created by communities, offering real insights into regenerative living.The profits are redistributed into the community of authors incentivising supporting books created within the ecosystem and enabling scholarships and community innovation.In other words:  Join a mastermind  Make a book and make impact  Make friends  Get your money back through book sales  Support the communityAs a community driven publisher we are very excited about experimenting with alternative approaches to marketing - focusing on human-to-human interactions IRL rather than digital ads.We‚Äôll be hosting another mastermind in April in Switzerland and then in the fall 2025 in Mexico, and you can express your interest by joining this telegram group.You can also hire our services for your organisation. Reach out to discuss what would you like to create with your team. It‚Äôs worth noting that while we‚Äôre starting with books, we‚Äôre already looking into building games and software using the same methodology.üì∏ We‚Äôre on it.Mastermind KPIsThat was all great, but (at least some of) you probably want stats.Here are a few:  14 authors  867 cards played  1 non-fiction illustrated book pdf  1 short fiction story included in the book  96 illustrations  1 short video (here)  1 documentation article (you‚Äôre reading it now)  4 reflection articles (here, here, here, and here)  1 mega twitter thread with live documentation (here)  1 community-driven publishing model (Tree House Collective)  1 workshop prototype (which got invited to a Swiss University Accelerator)  16 book pre-orders  ‚Ç¨453 pre-order revenue  ~10 visitors during the open day  ~25 participants in the digital call  22 participants in pol.is sense-making  18 new followers on key marketing channels/mailing list  Daily record: 51 pages created in 3 hoursüì∏ Chilling on a sunny day after the work/play is done.  ‚ÄúGratitude and bliss are my two keywords.‚Äù*‚Äì BigeThere‚Äôs also metrics that are harder to quantify such as:  1:1 dates  community rituals / habits / practices / culture blocks  cuddle puddles  business opportunities  unexpected value creationFuture metrics to track (note to self):  returning authors  time to print  time to repay authors  authors meeting in other containers  average number of pages per dayImprovements BraindumpWhile the process flew extremely well there is definitely space for improvements. Here are a few ideas.  Bring in the external proof-reading earlier  Host the open day in a city (more people)  Page auction to fund the first print run  Use the open day digital walkthrough as a base structure for the promo video &amp; improve the quality of sound  Invite previous authors to the open day and build a THC gathering around it  Improve the promotion of the authors with dedicated boost sessions, eg. improve your linkedin, website etc with the collective brainpower - make this a part of the container design!  Consider dropping the group deeper in the first week  Play more with creating and decentralising rolesPersonal Learnings  It is the longest container I‚Äôve hosted so far and I absolutely loved it. I‚Äôm curious to experiment with even a longer format.  My intuition was confirmed - the month-long mastermind format is DOPE. We‚Äôll surely iterate on it every time but the basic framework is set and it works like a charm. I feel super happy and proud of building this experience.  It is also the perfect container for me to exist within. Hanging out with people I love and creating something meaningful together makes me feel alive like not many other things. This is the lifestyle I want, and luckily I am building it.  I‚Äôm ready to scale this up as a service and create impact and value for aligned organisations  The last week of the month was intense with pretty much no mental capacity for anything else. Next time I wish to accommodate better for it.  A month long container is a perfect anchor to build habits, such as an exercise routine.Next StepsWe‚Äôre now collecting pre-orders to fund the first print run. We expect to ship in November/December 2024. The next (mega) milestone is to sell ~5000 copies to pay authors back before the next mastermind in April 2025.You can order your copy here and this would make a tremendous difference for us!üì∏ So many smiling faces send good vibes your way!.In the meantime we‚Äôre setting up Tree House Collective as a legal entity.Finally, we‚Äôre inviting people for the next mastermind in our epic venue Vermont Hub, Swizerland in April 2025 and then in Mexico in the fall 2025. Join this telegram group or reach out to me directly to create the next book with us.You can also hire us to deliver a mastermind (or a mini-mastermind) in your organisation. Contact me directly to discuss your needs.If you want to follow my personal journey I invite you to read my Moonly Reviews, peak into my microblog on telegram, or interact with me on twitter.And if you want to get my support in designing your own kick-ass container, then you can book me for a 1:1.Have a wonderful Day,Micha≈Ç",

Anyone could propose any activity to happen in any time outside of the 3 hour book making session.</p><p>Here are a few examples to showcase the variety:</p><ul>  <li>a trip to a local farm</li>  <li>contact improv</li>  <li>watching a film</li>  <li>intro to Ayurveda</li>  <li>intro to Enspiral</li>  <li>a workshop prototype around lessons we can learn from being at sea</li>  <li>and more‚Ä¶</li></ul><p>If you‚Äôre not familiar with Open Space, have a look <a href=\"https://openspaceworld.org/wp2/what-is/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-morning.jpg\" alt=\"Morning session vibes\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><em>üì∏ The delightful vibe of our morning moment together.</em></p><p>After the moment of creating a daily group coherence and planning the day we jumped into 3 hours of book creation playtime (more on that later).</p><p>Next, we‚Äôd float into lunch served by our amazing chef <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anotherjosefina/\" target=\"_blank\">Josefina</a>.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-food.jpg\" alt=\"Food pic. Yes, it looks super tasty\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><em>üì∏ A food pic for your delight.</em></p><p>Afternoon varied from day to day depending on open space offerings, but usually included a session of squash or other physical activity, before coming back together again for dinner prepped by daily rotating teams.</p><p>Evenings depended on open space, and usually the day ended with someone turning on the sauna üî•. And then, half way through the mastermind, we discovered that sauna in the morning is an amazing way to start the day. We also discovered that quite a few of us were waking up very early which kickstarted our 5am/6am/7am club.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-squares.jpg\" alt=\"Ticking boxes\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><em>üì∏ Here‚Äôs the boxes representing images to make.

The house felt super quiet and cozy.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-rest.jpg\" alt=\"Deep rest time\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><em>üì∏ A well deserved moment of ultimate chill. Bonus points for the hat!</em></p><p>On the second day the energy was back and we‚Äôd go for a hike, or just hang out in nature. This is also when many great creative ideas for the book sparked and we begun our famous balcony sessions.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-balcony.jpg\" alt=\"Balcony vibes\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><em>üì∏ The vibe is always excellent on the balcony.</em></p><blockquote>  <p><em>‚Äú</em>I could do these masterminds all of my life.<em>‚Äú</em><br />‚Äì Ani<br /></p></blockquote><h3 id=\"zooming-in-on-3h-creative-sprints\">Zooming in on 3h Creative Sprints</h3><p>The book was done in dedicated 3 hour sessions. No AI, just the limitless human creativity in flowstate with cards as a primary medium.</p><p>The process goes through stages of free-flow brainstorming and sense-making, constrained by the format of book pages, which keeps the group focused and effective. In the meantime, our illustrator keeps on drawing.</p><p>The speed is incredible. Our daily record was 51 pages!</p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-cardification.jpg\" alt=\"Playing with cards\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><em>üì∏ The daily process of cardification.</em></p><p><strong>The most important part is, of course, the vibe. We are able to co-create so effectively because we‚Äôre in a constant state of play with the group quickly learning how to self-facilitate and adjust the process to match the energy in the room.</strong></p><p>The result is a beautiful illustrated book.</p><blockquote>  <p><em>‚Äú</em>It was such a creative process. I‚Äôm proud to be behind this book!‚Äù*<br />‚Äì Yoav<br /></p></blockquote><h2 id=\"why-semi-nomadism\">Why Semi-Nomadism?</h2><p>I‚Äôve started this article with the process, because (in my opinion) the process makes 65% of the mastermind experience. On the other hand, the book is the focusing point for the month and the reason why we came together.</p><p>We picked the topic of semi-nomadism because it feels relevant and fascinating to explore.</p><p>The (digital) nomad lifestyle is by now quite well established in the global awareness, with a plenty of people living this way and plenty of resources and services catering to their needs. In the same time I keep noticing a growing need for stability and roots. I feel it myself - traveling is fantastic, but being constantly on the move doesn‚Äôt fulfil me anymore. I wish to have a base (or a few bases) to come back to, and see their growth over a longer period of time, while growing myself shaped by it. <strong>This mutual shaping - of a place by the person, and of a person by the place became a somewhat of a guiding definition for what a semi-nomad actually is</strong>.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-nomad-preview-definition.jpg\" alt=\"Page preview\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><em>üì∏ Preview of the book pages.</em></p><p>The word semi-nomad itself was fascinating to dissect.</p><p>After all the prefix <em>semi</em> indicates being ‚Äúpartly something‚Äù, so being ‚Äúnot quite nomadic‚Äù. While accurate to a degree, we felt that it puts too much emphasis on the nomadic aspect, while the key piece of the puzzle for us was the aspect of having a home, or multiple homes.</p><p>We explored alternative word choices (such as <em>homad</em> and <em>rooted nomad</em>), but in the end decided to stay with <em>semi-nomad</em>, as a good enough and safe enough. Our fired brains produced a wonderful poem though:</p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-poem.jpg\" alt=\"Semi Nomad Poem\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><em>üì∏ It was fun to read it out loud during dinner.</em></p><p>If you have better words to describe the phenomena, you can contribute to the conversation on <a href=\"https://pol.is/3uknvwxnxt\" target=\"_blank\">polis</a> and <a href=\"https://t.me/+S9wYSmjLOhZhMWNk\" target=\"_blank\">telegram</a>.</p><p>The definition was one of many rabbit holes we embarked upon. <strong>The book is a snapshot of our collective exploration of the subject through multiple lenses, such as self, relationships, practical life-admin stuff (hooray tax and health insurance) and offers a collection of perspectives to consider when choosing to build a semi-nomadic lifestyle.</strong></p><p>Here are a few pages to look at:</p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-preview-gnome.jpg\" alt=\"Page preview\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-preview-container.jpg\" alt=\"Page preview\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/semi-preview-home.jpg\" alt=\"Page preview\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p>I mentioned already the feeling of shared identity stemming from creating a tangible deliverable together. I can‚Äôt wait to see the smile on authors faces when they will hold the physical print in their hands for the first time.</p><p>There‚Äôs also something around the medium of a book itself that is particularly appealing. A book is a book. It is a format well recognised by both the mainstream and alternative pockets of cultural landscape and it carries a degree of seriousness and respectability that can transmit the ideas into the wider ecosystem.</p><p>After all, <strong>we‚Äôre writing about topics within the wide ranging spectrum of regeneration, community and culture, with the intention of inspiring others to co-create a world where all beings can thrive</strong>.</p><blockquote>  <p><em>‚Äú</em>I‚Äôm leaving with more than just filled pages. I carry with me a renewed sense of my worth, a strength that comes from a community with shared alignment, and a desire to infuse more magic into every moment..‚Äù*<br />‚Äì Lucile<br /></p></blockquote><h2 id=\"our-community-driven-publishing-studio\">Our Community Driven Publishing Studio</h2><p><img src=\"/assets/media-semi-nomad/thc-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Tree House Collective Cover Image\" width=\"100%\" /></p><p>Tree House Collective is a community-driven publishing studio.

My notebook filled with amazing connections and new collaborations are sprouting all along.I‚Äôve learnt that my energy is endless, because just like you, I am energy. Whenever tired all that is need is a moment of a high quality recharge - whether by having a nap, cuddle, or dancing wild in the middle of a drum circle. The energy rises again and the Flow continues.And why host 13 workshops in the first place?Because it‚Äôs fun. Because it‚Äôs possible. Because it‚Äôs the best contribution I could have made to the Gathering.There is no time to wait to deploy your gifts. Whatever is the piece of the puzzle that you are called to build - the time is Now.Or, in the words of my Shaman:What‚Äôs up for me in this next months?  I‚Äôm hosting a book writing mastermind in Switzerland about Semi-Nomadic Lifestyle (live documentation twitter thread), come visit on the Open Day on the 19th of October  Completing my commercial officer license for sailing ships up to 500 tonnes  Organising a sailing expedition to Antarctica ‚õµÔ∏èüßä  Another book writing in Switzerland in April (topic TBC)  and more - sailing trips, writing 100 books in a month (yup), making a musical, growing Enspiral Europe.

That‚Äôs the perfect signpost towards an epic growth curve.If you want to follow my journey I invite you to read my Moonly Reviews, peak into my microblog on telegram, or interact with me on twitter.

            "content_text": "‚Äì Hey Micha≈Ç, do you want to organise a trip on my ship?¬†‚Äì it‚Äôs the kind of offer I just wouldn‚Äôt ignore. Gathering epic crew is one of my favourite processes in the world. So I crafted an invitation and sent it out to some of my favourite humans ‚õµÔ∏èDespite 3 weeks notice the voyage sold out all spots, and gathered so much energy that I‚Äôm already planning the next one (more info at the end).Here‚Äôs the retrospective from my first Boat Burn, starting with a 48 seconds video:(click this link if the video doesn‚Äôt load.)WTF is a Boat Burn?Since my first immersion into the world of Burns - co-created gatherings in unforgiving environments, inspired by Burning Man - I had a feeling that ships could use more Burners.Why?First of all, a sailing vessel is a fantastic space to bring people together, Burners or non-burners.There‚Äôs nothing quite like the feeling of adventure, freedom, connection to oneself and the natural world, and the profound empowerment coming from the fact of being out there, in the wild sea, magically cutting across the vastness on a tiny piece of boat which for the time of the journey becomes your entire world.However, there‚Äôs another facet of sailing that has my particular interest - building culture.Stepping on a ship is like entering a pressure cooker. There is no privacy, there is no escape, and your life kinda depends on each other, so you simply need to work well together. Emotions get amplified and results of your actions (or lack of thereof) are immediate. In such an intense environment conflicts can get nasty and friendships forged at sea are simply next level.Ships also come with its unique context and constraints.On top of the usual complexity of group dynamics and processes, you have to consider the weather, sea-sickness, voyage plan, local restrictions (eg. no loud sounds on deck after 22h in Dutch harbours), the vessel and its ways of doing things, and of course the captain - who is legally responsible for everything on board.So what happens when we bring a crew of Burners on a sailing ship?Well, Burners are dream builders, coming together for a short period of time to make anything-you-want possible through effective cooperation, hard work, connecting on a deeper level, nourishing each other, not taking life too seriously, and having a lot of fun. That already feels like a great potential for crew.At the core of Burns, there are the principles, such as radical participation (rather than expecting service), gifting, leave no trace, self-expression and consent, making it possible for people from different backgrounds to harmonise into a collective flow state of co-creation.What burners are usually very good at is defining explicit cultural norms making sure that everyone‚Äôs needs are met and essential things still get done. As explored in the community building book I co-written, everything that is explicit can be adjusted.In practical terms, it comes down to making agreements around topics important to the crew. How do we want to be together? How do we relate to photos, nudity, sex, substances? How do we decide about music to listen to, and when to have silence?It‚Äôs not always an easy process, and yet it works like magic.As a sailor graduated from the Enkhuizer Zeevaartschool working towards commanding ships up to 500 tonnes, it‚Äôs not a coincidence that I‚Äôm also the co-captain of Sheepy Ship - a camp at Nowhere (European Burn), with a mission of connecting burner sailors and gathering crew for future expeditions. I love being in the space where these two amazing worlds overlap.The Mast of the Sheepy Ship, beaconing sailors at Nowhere 2024. Photo by Sean TooleMuddy Tales Voyage DesignOur voyage followed the three act structure of Burning Man events: Build - Sail - Strike.1. BuildMany burners say there is no burn without build.Guided by the captain and the owner, we spend 3 days on de-rusting and repainting the deck, rails and mast, refitting the windows, as well as uplifting the space inside the boat to make it more functional and cosy.Building ships at Nowhere and refitting ships at sea.For a community used to building cities in a dessert, giving energy to the ship before setting sail was a pleasure. We created a deeper bond with the vessel, established trust with the captain, brought the crew closer together, and our floating home, Chateauroux, looked better than ever!Fun fact: as we were blasting heavy tools on a Sunday working on the deck we got kicked out of the marina for making too much noise (totally fair - we had 3 needle hammers going). The situation attracted a lot of communication on the radio - while the noise was annoying, local skippers were very impressed by the hard work and progress we were making. It was definitely not your usual group! As a bonus we moved to a much better spot.  ‚ÄúI have not been a part of such an integrated group for years!‚Äù‚Äì Darya2. SailOn the first day of our voyage the captain asked me to collect the sailing dreams of the crew. I collected them into our log and we start making them happen.Through the next 7 days we explored some of the most amazing places in the Netherlands, while learning how to sail together and creating beautiful moments of deep connection, creativity and play.Manouvering a 30m traditional vessel requires many hands to pull on ropes. Since we were only sailing during the day, we divided the crew into two teams (watches) of 9, switching roles every day.The sailing watch manoeuvred the ship and engaged in pop up sailing classes. The care watch nourished the crew with food, cleaned the space, and engaged in various acts of fluffing such as strawberries and massages.To embody the culture of participation we practiced dynamic leadership with people naturally stepping into roles of responsibility whenever the need occurred. This significantly reduced the coordinating overheads while relaxing the atmosphere and everything still got done right on time and with better quality that we could ever plan.As a bonus we also had one joker - a special role with no particular responsibility beyond what they wanted to engage in - a treat for the lucky one.  ‚ÄúI felt extremely loved.‚Äù‚Äì Simone3. StrikeLeave No Trace is one of the core principles of the Burn culture.On the last day of the trip we took down all the decorations and deep-cleaned the ship, leaving Chateauroux and its‚Äô crew in a much better state that we found them.The local custom is that the captain and mate prepare beds for the next voyage, during precious hours of break in between having groups on board. It felt fantastic to take over that responsibility and give them extra rest - a simple yet meaningful act of care.Captain, perhaps more than anyone, also deserves some love!We are aspiring to Leave Positive Trace, rather than no trace at all.  ‚ÄúIt was the first time that I could really be myself.‚Äù‚Äì Benjamin, the mate of ChateaurouxLife On BoardLarge sailing vessels offers considerable advantages in comparison to small yachts.More crew means more diversity and makes it easier to retreat whenever one craves self-time. The bigger vessel means more space - both for creating different areas, as well as brining more stuff.As a group of people used to building fantastical cities in a dessert, optimising the space to its full potential came very naturally. We brought lights, a soundsystem, multiple instruments, costumes, circus equipment, art supplies, fabrics, etc, and transformed Chateauroux into a cosy paradise playground, while maintaining its core functionality as a safe sailing vessel.Last, but not least - sailing ships are epic, unique and come with a story that one is proud to be a part of. And don‚Äôt get me wrong - small yachts offer fantastic opportunities for sailing, but it‚Äôs just a totally different experience.And, of course, it‚Äôs very easy to find your vessel in the marina.Arriving to Passaia aboard Grahound in a fleet of yachts and tall ships was mindblowing.Two decades of experience as a facilitator have shown me that the best events are over-prepared and under-structured. This fits perfectly with the Burn culture where there are no spectators and everyone is equally responsible for co-creating the experience.With no fixed agenda, the space was constantly open for anyone to initiate an activity, resulting in the perfect alignment with the needs of the group in any given moment.Wild Cards Journey on deck of Chateauroux.The result was fantastic - a great combination of sailing, quality time in nature, party, deep connection, blissful chill, performances, making music and more.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve experienced such a feeling of freedom, and motion, and openess of the heart. It was a deeply profound expedition.‚Äù‚Äì Jo√£oFeeding the CrewInstead of a designated daily meal plan to follow, we provisioned the boat with ingredients that are nutritious, easy to work with, and fun to play with to inspire improvised meals created by whoever stepped into the role of a daily chef.The core idea was to source ingredients for the most common denominator (food that everyone can eat), and build meals as a combination of base + sauce, with more money invested into making knock-out sauces that would work on any meal and be absolutely freaking delicious.  ‚ÄúIt all starts with a sauce.‚Äù‚Äì SharonIt worked out perfectly - we had a close-to-fine-dining experience on a daily basis, with very little time spent on meal planning and coordination, with plenty of leftovers, and ~20% of the budget to spare. And the majority of fruits and vegetables came from a local organic farm.When buying ingredients we went through the following criteria:  Food budget total + buffer 10%  Amount of people, days and meals  Dietary restrictions  Cooking facilities and storage  Weather (hot / cold)  Nutrition / Flexibility / Ease of cooking / Fun  Energy required (eg. build needs more food)And we had two guiding questions for daily chefs:  What do we have a lot of?  What‚Äôs going bad?The ArtefactAn artefact is a physical object co-created by all participants during the event. Creating them is my specialty.Since every ship is legally responsible to carry a log, what could be more suitable than involving everyone in narrating our adventure in a collective journal? We filled it with memories, photos, and forms of artistic expression.  ‚ÄúIt was the most intense and one of the best burns. I fucking loved it and I‚Äôm waiting for the next one.‚Äù‚Äì IlaiPersonal LearningsMuddy Tales left me with a profound sense of gratitude. It was my first expedition organised on a bigger sailing vessel, and I expanded a lot as a facilitator and a quartermaster. Here are a few asorted learnings:  It was the first time ever I had to ask a person to leave (after 3 days of build) due to persistent behaviour that was making the group uncomfortable (I won‚Äôt go into detail). The process felt very healthy, and the final decision was taken by me as a representative of the crew (aka the quartermaster) and the captain - a perfect example of Pirate Organising. It felt challenging to exclude a person, and yet it was the perfect decision for the voyage.  I have prioritised personal invitations rather than posting on social channels and I absolutely loved it. While it takes more energy to communicate 1:1 rather than 1-to-many, the relationships built through the process feel more in tune with the long term vision of building a community of sailors. Due to very short notice many people simply couldn‚Äôt make it, but are very much looking forward to the next opportunity.  I have succeeded in distributing a lot of tasks on board - for example shooting the promo video. It felt so much better to ask people to film specific shots and give basic instructions rather than have to film myself or have a designated camera person carrying all the load.Next StepsAs we concluded the voyage it hit me that another dream came true - I brought people together on a sailing ship, and it was absolutely delightful. The smiling faces and glowing eyes at the end were enough of the confirmation that this is just the beginning.The long term vision is to connect land-based projects and host adventures at sea. My role is to bring amazing crew to epic ships to connect, work and play together. The next voyage is already cooking up!If you‚Äôd like to be a part of this journey, I‚Äôd love to connect with you.

It felt challenging to exclude a person, and yet it was the perfect decision for the voyage.</li>  <li><strong>I have prioritised personal invitations rather than posting on social channels and I absolutely loved it</strong>. While it takes more energy to communicate 1:1 rather than 1-to-many, the relationships built through the process feel more in tune with the long term vision of building a community of sailors. Due to very short notice many people simply couldn‚Äôt make it, but are very much looking forward to the next opportunity.</li>  <li><strong>I have succeeded in distributing a lot of tasks on board - for example shooting the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/dPkeRCvKJp8\" target=\"_blank\">promo video</a></strong>. It felt so much better to ask people to film specific shots and give basic instructions rather than have to film myself or have a designated camera person carrying all the load.</li></ul><h2 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps</h2><p>As we concluded the voyage it hit me that another dream came true - I brought people together on a sailing ship, and it was absolutely delightful.

            "content_text": "  After feeling disconnected from Beltane for a couple of years, the spirit of the ceremony called me yet again to put my wizard cloak on, paint myself Red, and climb up a Hill to light a sacred Fire and face my internal Underworld.üî•Beltane marks the transition from Winter to Summer, a middle point between the Spring Equinox and Summer Solstice. I was first exposed to it when living in Edinburgh, Scotland.Back then, I participated in three Beltanes, burning away the Winter on Calton Hill, with another 300 painted Beings coming together for one night after a few months of preparation. Part performance, part ceremony, the Beltane Fire Festival is witnessed by a big crowd of spectators. Being there as one of the ‚Äúperformers‚Äù is one of the most marking ceremonies in my life.The third time was particularly powerful, as it marked not only the beginning of Summer, but also the beginning of a new lifecycle for me. I was about to leave Edinburgh, my Home for seven years and my spiritual hometown, a couple of days after Beltane.I‚Äôll never forget the energy of that night.In my interpretation of the Beltane tale, the May Queen journeys through the Underworld together with her old partner - the Green Man, gradually stripped of everything he wears. The journey culminates in a Ritual of Death, where the May Queen takes the life of her naked partner marking passing away of the Winter, and then brings his breath back in an act of Revival. The Spring is here again and the life in its pure, wild form begins to flourish.üå±üå±üå±I see it as the embodiment of the Cycle of Life, where passing of the Old is necessary to make space for the New. Death is a vital process of Rebirth, and Beltane serves as a reminder of the necessity of letting go of attachments.At least that‚Äôs how I see it.This year I felt particularly connected to a ritual of letting go of my past Loves - something that kept popping up for a few weeks before Beltane through different interactions. While not being in a committed romantic relationship, I did feel connected, and indeed attached to the incredible women who have been my life partners for some time at various stages of my journey.It was time to set them (and myself) free - and make space for the new season of life.Ritual DesignIt all starts with a commitment.As I returned from a short and powerful journey to the Mainland I felt called to celebrate Beltane, and specifically  to Burn the attachments to my past Loves. I decided to follow my intuition and committed to making it happen. Once committed, the rest is practicalities.During the next couple of days I kept bringing my attention to my upcoming ritual, to keep tuning into what it will actually look like.First of all - How does one burn their attachments?What felt right for me, was to go through my journals and grab precious Gifts from my Loves, such as very special letters and magickal objects, and start piling them up. To be transparent with you, I still have a box of old letters in a box in my parents house, so I haven‚Äôt actually collected everything, but that didn‚Äôt feel relevant at all.At the end of the day, I am setting myself to perform an act of psychomagic, and with a clear intention in place, I get to choose the embodiment of that intention through a set of physical actions I choose to perform. In my case, burning some of the letters, knowing that there‚Äôs more in my parents house, felt like a sufficient manifestation of the ritual I was about to perform and it would have been simply impractical as fuck to get my parents to ship my personal letters all the way to the island where I live.Even wizards need to be practical sometimes.‚öôÔ∏èWith the pile of precious gifts growing daily, I directed my attention into the actual ritual. The first question being:Where do I want to do it?My Cabin seemed like an easy choice, but it didn‚Äôt feel right. I do associate Beltane with climbing a Hill, and there is something very special about going into Nature to witness a ceremony. With no designated Beltane spot in the island where I live (contrary to Edinburgh, where Calton Hill is the Beltane hill) I got to choose a spot that resonates. Once I knew that I am looking for a hill within a walkable distance from my Cabin, the right space was immediately clear - a hill around one hour walk away, with a magnificent view and a beautiful energy. It‚Äôs a spot that I don‚Äôt visit that often and it felt immediately right.With the space set, I connected with the actual ritual.What do I want to do? How do I embody the ceremony?  In my understanding of psychomagick, the difficulty of the act generates the energy that gets directed into Magick, through enactment of intuitive motions based on the ritual design.üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAs with all Magickal acts, there is a part to it which is based on pure intuition, and it makes zero sense to plan it in advance. Instead of thinking about the actual ritual, I tuned into what are the objects I want to take with me. It came up one day as a drawing in my journal, which might be illegible to you, but is meaningful to me:I spent the next few days collecting the necessary items. Once the Beltane night came I was ready.The Ritual  What happens on the Hill stays on the Hill.I won‚Äôt go into details of how my Beltane ceremony looked like, because the set of actions was deeply intuitive and connected with the essence of my Being at that point of time, needing to go through certain specific motions meaningful to me. If you want to know the details, ask me in person and I might share more.With that in mind, I‚Äôd like to share a few observations, as they might be useful for your own process:  Walking to the Hill, with my Red warpaint and wizard cloak on and a backpack containing all the items needed for the ritual, felt incredibly grounding. Walking is my meditation and I loved having the long process of embodied transition before entering the Space.  Perhaps this is obvious but I‚Äôll share anyway: I left all my digital devices at home. I want to be fully present.  As I enter the sacred space I totally surrender to the fact that I have no idea what I am doing and I have no idea what to say. I have no spells - and that‚Äôs okay. The only thing I need to do is to bring myself to the state of full presence and from there act intuitively based on what is happening and what are the objects I have with me. There is no right or wrong, and what I actually do doesn‚Äôt matter at all. It is all about directing my intention into embodied acts and tuning into what wants to happen next. In ritual spaces I am acting from a place of intuition. There is no place for ‚Äúperfection‚Äù or intelectual analysis of the act itself.  To create a clear boundary of the Sacred Space I Open the Space and then I Close it. It‚Äôs perhaps another obvious point, but I‚Äôll share it anyway. Clear boundaries are crucial.  I didn‚Äôt end up burning everything. During the ceremony it felt obvious to me that certain objects want to be kept in this world, and the only thing I need to do is to relinquish my temporary stewardship of them and pass them on to another person who could use them well.  Gifts are meant to gravitate towards where they are needed most, and it‚Äôs my role as their temporary steward to support that journey.  I burnt everything else.ResultsI don‚Äôt see a point in quantifying the results of a psychomagick act. Not everything needs to become data points. What matters is the feelings that came up. Feeling lighter. Feeling confident. Feeling vibrant. Feeling alive. Feeling free. Feeling kind.I am carrying these with me beyond the ceremony, which of course is the biggest challenge.The ceremony is an act, a specific moment in time surfacing the inner underworld to the surface so I can engage with it consciously. As I journeyed through my Fears and Loves I got to reconnect with the energy of the most incredible Women that chose to share some of their lives with me - the most precious Gift that shaped me, and will never be forgotten. The act of releasing my attachments felt pure and beautiful.  The Beauty is to Let it Go.I Love my Loves, and therefore I set them Free. Through the act of setting them Free I set myself free and I make space for another cycle of my life to flourish.The Summer is now here.‚òÄÔ∏è",

            "content_text": "Back in December I committed to 33 consecutive days of 30 minutes yoga without skipping a single day. Long story short: I did it.To be honest - it was not difficult. I‚Äôve set the difficulty bar well - right at the edge between feeling easy and feeling challenging to start, and I made it absolutely non-negotiable under any circumstances knowing the importance of delivering on that vow to myself.Stepping into my 33rd rep on the day of my 34th birthday felt like bliss.With the original commitment out of the way I simply continued showing up to my practice. I was in the middle of a crazy fast travel, when for over a month I moved every couple of days, and, perhaps paradoxically, it felt easier to just keep on doing my practice every day. It served as a grounding ritual shifting my awareness into the body in the midst of all the changes in the external environment. It was a perfect fit.Eventually, I came back home and decided to recommit. One hundred days. Actually, make it one hundred and one, because it feels like a good number of unbroken reps.I did it again, although I admit that I could feel my commitment energy drop significantly. I still kept showing up, but there were more days when I wasn‚Äôt showing up fully. ‚ÄúBad days‚Äù are a natural part of the commitment and, in fact, are the most important ones.  It‚Äôs when you don‚Äôt feel like it, and yet you show up anyway, that the muscles of will grow.Still - I kept noticing that the frequency of these days increased, which kept draining my motivation further down.Eventually there was not much left, but then‚Ä¶ I hit the 101 mark.Setting the right time frame is another critical piece of the Art of Commitment. A longer period increases the probability of giving up - either through random life events or, like in my case, motivation dropping down with time. On the other hand, the longer your streak, the more badass you feel so there is definitely immense value in high number of reps. Completing 101 consecutive days of 30 minutes yoga practice without skipping a beat felt very fucking good.I decided to ride the wave of completion and recommitted to 125 days. Another 24 days felt doable.On day 119 I quit.Ending a non-negotiable commitment well is a mission-critical part of the process.I kept noticing that my motivation is quite low, and the frequency of days when I push through is increasing. And then, one day after the most amazing yoga session I had in a long time, with a glass totally full with recommitment energy, I suffered an injury rendering it impossible to continue in the same format.I tried to change my practice to a very gentle movement on the yoga mat, and then shifted to moving the energy in my body in a healing process, but the truth is - my heart was not in the original commitment to 125 days of yoga.I have no time for bullshit. I had two options:  Recommit immediately and kept pushing through  Let goI chose the later knowing well that I didn‚Äôt honour my commitment, and yet, quitting was a respectful thing to do. My heart wasn‚Äôt there, my body wasn‚Äôt fully mobile, and I needed to prioritise healing rather than forcing myself.In other words, my current life circumstances were not aligned with my commitment, and while I absolutely could have chosen to do it regardless, I made a conscious decision not to.Instead, I decided to renegotiate my commitment.And then I weaved it into a card representing my current core practices so I can see it all the time.Redirecting the commitment energy into a different practice is a fantastic lifeline but also a very tricky ground. Similarly to the original non-negotiable commitment it deserves consideration and respect.An easy trap to fall into, is to redirect the energy from a place of half-assing - well, that thing didn‚Äôt work out, so let me try this other thing. It‚Äôs easy to slip into not taking the new commitment seriously, which will most likely backfire - in a form of giving up during one of the first challenging periods.Building on the first rule of habit building - never skip twice - it‚Äôs time to regain trust in myself by honouring my commitment no matter what.This requires setting the commitment well.  What is the commitment?  What is the timeframe?  Am I ready to make it a non-negotiable vow, knowing well that if I fail to deliver it will harm my feeling of self-worth and trust in myself?With full awareness of the stakes at play, I decided to commit to a daily swim.I am in an environment where I can go into the water daily, unless the sea state is completely wild, and even if it is, there is a high chance I can find a spot to get into the water. There is a possibility that external circumstances beyond my control (as in: Nature) will make it impossible, in which case I will accept it and have a long cold shower instead. But I will go out of my way to find a spot to swim.Respecting that my body is still not fully healed, I set the bar low - All I need to do is to fully submerge in the water. I can then get out immediately. This feels like a good bar of difficulty - no brainer on easy days, and whenever I don‚Äôt feel like swimming at all, it‚Äôs still easy to drag my ass into the water.I don‚Äôt need to commit to more - once submerged I‚Äôll enjoy it tremendously.Once my new commitment is crystal clear to me, I ponder on the timeframe that feels good. I‚Äôll set a low bar this time because I want to reduce the risk of failure. Still, I want something that feels like a bit of a challenge and aligns with my natural rhythms.I choose to commit to a daily swim until the next New Moon. That‚Äôs 21 days away from today, and I have a head start of 4 completed days, which is a good start of momentum.Am I ready to commit?ABSOLUTELY.üê†How about you?",

            "content_text": "I‚Äôve spent the summer of 2022 immersed in Traditional Dream Factory - a regenerative village with super-high-energy social context overflowing with all sorts of in-real-life relating. As my stewardsheep üêë came to an end I returned to Pico island. Suddenly I am spending pretty much all of my time alone.It‚Äôs a huge shift.After being with people pretty much constantly for four months I felt overloaded. TDF is an amazing place to live, and it is indeed one of my Homes, and yet I could not find the balance between social time and self time - for all the right reasons.In a place where the official language is laughter and people genuinely care for each other it‚Äôs easy to slip into interacting constantly.Creating self-time in a community is something to practice, and there are many ways to do it:Setting boundaries for self-time. Going away for a few days. Creating spaces for silence. Setting cues for not being disturbed.Today I&#39;m experimenting with new visual cue helping me to stay focused in a high-energy creative vortex environment: @tdfinyourdreams pic.twitter.com/RAcYYlzjTz&mdash; Micha≈Ç ‚ú® (@michalkorzonek) August 31, 2022Damn, I had so much fun.Of course, there was also conflict and interpersonal tensions. This is a given when bringing people together. But that doesn‚Äôt discourage me at all. In fact - quite the opposite: I find a strange fascination for conflict in groups.Conflict reveals peoples‚Äô ‚Äútrue colours‚Äù, how they behave under pressure, and what are their trauma points. This is invaluable information for any group that wants to create something meaningful together.Now, all of this is gone, and it‚Äôs just the silly old me again.Hi.Toolkit upgrade. Worth every cent. pic.twitter.com/59k74z6wYS&mdash; Micha≈Ç ‚ú® (@michalkorzonek) October 13, 2022Surprisingly, although that‚Äôs perhaps due to my naivety, being in the space with little-to-none IRL deep relating for a couple of days, I find myself inside emotional whirlpool, as intense as when I was at TDF.The excitements, frustrations, and all sorts of moments of intensity of various flavours still exist, but now they all happen within me. The entire internal ecosystem of parts came out to play, encouraged by the silence around me.Somehow it feels way more challenging to be immersed in that context.It also feels necessary.It‚Äôs my growth edge.I‚Äôm regaining balance.This summer, I practiced finding stillness in the moments of absolute chaos. Now it‚Äôs time to find stillness inside of me.Fortunately, I am in the most wonderful place to practice - a volcanic rock immersed in Awe Inspiring Nature.I invite you to fly through my window together üê¶ pic.twitter.com/M881KZBfUX&mdash; Micha≈Ç ‚ú® (@michalkorzonek) May 17, 2022As I allow myself to Be, I begin to recalibrate and ground.

And then, out of nowhere, there it is - my CabinI lived in many homes and this one was my favourite - a tiny wooden cabin in the middle of a beautiful forest, with a window into the Ocean.(tweet with drone video flying though that view)I was given an opportunity to live here and customise the insides to fit my lifestyle. Wood is a perfect canvas. Over a few months the Cabin transformed into a powerful creativity boosting power place, and a blueprint for my future Home.Before:After:Technical InfoInside Area: 3x3m2Approx build cost: ‚Ç¨3500 (a while ago)Electricity &amp; water from the grid (for now)Not insulated (although I spent 2 winters there and it was fine)Roof: Double tin with foamBlueprint design:Would you like a tour?Here‚Äôs a youtube video where I‚Äôll show you around.ReflectionsA wise man once said that it takes three houses to build a perfect one. While I haven‚Äôt built the cabin myself (I only helped a bit with finishing and did some interior improvements), it gives me a great starting point for creating my first home, whenever the time for it comes.A few improvements I‚Äôd consider doing with the cabin design:  Sand and varnish all the wood inside - without it there‚Äôs plenty of wood dust, which can‚Äôt be too healthy to breathe.  Invest in good doors - the doors to the cabin are not very thick and in very heavy rainfall the water comes through.  Opening windows at the top - this would add an easy way to keep the air flowing in times when opening the front doors is not a viable option.  Add a wood burning stove - this is a bit tricky, since it‚Äôs a tiny wooden house, but there must be a way to have a tiny wooden stove inside to heat the place up in winter without relying on electricity.  Consider adding insulation - I‚Äôm not 100% sure about this because it would take some precious space, but it might be worthwhile especially on cold days. It would be a big improvement to add insulation at the roof only.  Soundproofing the roof - when it rains it can get very loud inside. Insulation would do the trick.  Instal a basic water system outside - I have a bucket with the water collected from the roof, which works, but adding a tiny bit of sophistication would be great.  Keep the food out - it‚Äôs not the cabin‚Äôs fault per se (I just don‚Äôt have a good food storage around), but I‚Äôd much rather not keep my eating station inside.  Add a trap door / hidden back door - for fun, and to have a second exit.

While I haven‚Äôt built the cabin myself (I only helped a bit with finishing and did some interior improvements), it gives me a great starting point for creating my first home, whenever the time for it comes.</p><p>A few improvements I‚Äôd consider doing with the cabin design:</p><ul>  <li><del><strong>Sand and varnish all the wood inside</strong> - without it there‚Äôs plenty of wood dust, which can‚Äôt be too healthy to breathe.</del></li>  <li><strong>Invest in good doors</strong> - the doors to the cabin are not very thick and in very heavy rainfall the water comes through.</li>  <li><strong>Opening windows at the top</strong> - this would add an easy way to keep the air flowing in times when opening the front doors is not a viable option.</li>  <li><strong>Add a wood burning stove</strong> - this is a bit tricky, since it‚Äôs a tiny wooden house, but there must be a way to have a tiny wooden stove inside to heat the place up in winter without relying on electricity.</li>  <li><strong>Consider adding insulation</strong> - I‚Äôm not 100% sure about this because it would take some precious space, but it might be worthwhile especially on cold days. It would be a big improvement to add insulation at the roof only.</li>  <li><strong>Soundproofing the roof</strong> - when it rains it can get very loud inside. Insulation would do the trick.</li>  <li><strong>Instal a basic water system outside</strong> - I have a bucket with the water collected from the roof, which works, but adding a tiny bit of sophistication would be great.</li>  <li><strong>Keep the food out</strong> - it‚Äôs not the cabin‚Äôs fault per se (I just don‚Äôt have a good food storage around), but I‚Äôd much rather not keep my eating station inside.</li>  <li><strong>Add a trap door / hidden back door</strong> - for fun, and to have a second exit.</li>  <li><strong>Cat flap</strong> for Kiki to move freely in and out üêà.</li></ul><h2 id=\"deep-work-retreat\">Deep Work Retreat</h2><p>I‚Äôm on a quest to raise funds for a community land in Pico, with a forest, a community space and a few cabins serving as a deep work / creative / personal regeneration retreat centre.</p><p>If you‚Äôd like to help to make this dream a reality, have a look at this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zbz3Ka5x7zVrJwBafn2mdW2oqRrdxNXoIMzwTkZiFIY/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">project brief</a>.

And since everything is written and managed directly inside my Obsidian vault, which is the central point of my digital focus, I can update anything I publish effortlessly, at any time, on my laptop or phone. I press Alt+Tab, write a letter ‚Äúg‚Äù (for GitHub Desktop to appear as the first result) and press enter. Then click ‚Äúcommit to main‚Äù and finalise the process by clicking ‚Äúpush origin‚Äù. Robots do their work, and the website is updated.It takes me approximately 2 seconds.I keep seeing all my files on the left. Folder structure includes (among other things) three web projects (my personal website, journalsmarter and microsolidarity in pico), each with /assets folder containing images. I can manipulate all files, restructure websites, move files from one project to another, link in between etc, and then in 2 seconds all changes are published.This is the first part of my strategy, which is complimented by the fact that not many people read my personal website (or at least I assume so, and I have no data to check, because the site has no tracking of any sort, which is a deliberate decision because I find tracking on the internet quite creepy. But I digress). Not many readers = not much pressure, in fact it‚Äôs probably just me and you right now who have ever visited this page.No resistance to publish + no pressure to publish is a combo that really does it for me.Here‚Äôs my current example:I was editing a poem which I wrote during a sailing trip which begun the transition into the chapter of my life that has just concluded as I write these words right now (okay, not exactly, but the actual day of the new beginning is only a couple of days off, which makes me smile feeling into the magical world of synchronicities).As I was editing the poem, an idea bounced into my mind: to start writing a meta article about my writing workflow, because it feels like a useful gift I could offer to someone who‚Äôd like to make writing a self-inflicted addiction.That‚Äôs kinda what happened to me.I struggled to build a digital publishing habit, so I turned it into addiction.( I can feel my certified habit coach part giving me a shoulder pat as I type these words, btw. )I clicked Ctrl+N, abandoned the poem for a while (we‚Äôll come back to it later), and begun writing a new note with a raw title How I Use My Personal Website.I furiously typed the next 598 words. Breath. 600.Then took this screenshot:(There will be a few more in this article - I‚Äôve been taking them occasionally since I want to show how I do it, instead of just telling the story.)If I‚Äôd like to publish it right now, I‚Äôd rename the name of the note by clicking on it - so it can be formatted for publishing. I‚Äôd call it:2022-04-18-personal-website-flowWhich would make me consider the title of this article. In the past I‚Äôd obsess about finding a perfect title, but now I‚Äôd just leave it as it is, noticing my recovering perfectionist part closing its eyes with horror!üôàThe part would get absolutely terrified, as it would begin following the note with this article being moved into the folder containing my published website./web/heymichal.github.io/_postsAt this point I actually went through the steps I just outlined, which brought the third look at the title of this article, which resulted in a decision to call it:Personal Website Flow - How I Use This WebsiteNot perfect, but good enough for now and safe enough to try.I‚Äôve copy-pasted the front matter from another post (I could have inserted it from template to make it faster), which forced me to add a description and relevant tags.And just like that this note is ready to publish.21üöÄIt‚Äôs live.Please note that it‚Äôs imperfect as fuck.I mean there is a paragraph typed below that I wrote before and decided not to include, but felt bad to delete it because it feels like a good paragraph to come back to at some point. Moreover, there are no screenshots included, and the links are all missing.Definitely suboptimal.But here‚Äôs the most important thing:I just published a 911 words article in 20 minutes or so. That‚Äôs a second thing I published today.Hey, I might tweet it, just for the laughs. I feel like it‚Äôs something that Rob would appreciate.As I get ready to copy the link so I can place it into the tweet, I start reading the published article. Perfect - I‚Äôll catch some basic spelling mistakes and small shit like that. I won‚Äôt bother with deep proof reading, images or links.‚è≥Proofreading is now complete, which means I can cmd+Tab to GitHub Desktop and commit.That is all, folks.Funny enough, I decide not to take this final step right now, because I notice that lonely paragraph again, and on an impulse decide to make it an integral part of this article, rather than leaving a few random lines at the end of the article completely out of context. I guess that‚Äôs fair to you..To give context, we need to return to the poem.I was editing it so I can get it ready for a spoken word collaboration with Jo√£o Moreira - one of the two Portuguese men whom I connected with deeply many years back in Albania, and on my return to Edinburgh which was my home at the time, I immediately booked my tickets to Portugal to fly there 2 months later. It turned out that I‚Äôd find a Person I would spend 8 years together with, and eventually move to Portugal, where I‚Äôm living now (although it‚Äôs not the continental part of Portugal).Okay, tangent finished. It‚Äôs still random. Forgive me.In any case, the poem is still awaiting editing, which is actually perfect, because I feel like my work here is done for now.I just need two clicks to republish this article, send the link to Rob, and then come back to what I was doing, before a sudden breeze of air would bring me here together with you.BIRDS SURFING OCEAN WIND VIDEO(video in tweet)I used to be a turtle.Now I am a bird.üê¶ps.

Not many readers = not much pressure, in fact it‚Äôs probably just me and you right now who have ever visited this page.</p><p>No resistance to publish + no pressure to publish is a combo that really does it for me.</p><p>Here‚Äôs my current example:</p><p>I was editing a <a href=\"/illuminated\" target=\"_blank\">poem</a> which I wrote during a sailing trip which begun the transition into the chapter of my life that has just concluded as I write these words right now (okay, not exactly, but the actual day of the new beginning is only a couple of days off, which makes me smile feeling into the magical world of synchronicities).</p><p>As I was editing the poem, an idea bounced into my mind: to start writing a meta article about my writing workflow, because it feels like a useful gift I could offer to someone who‚Äôd like to make writing a self-inflicted addiction.</p><p>That‚Äôs kinda what happened to me.</p><p><strong>I struggled to build a digital publishing habit, so I turned it into addiction.</strong></p><p>( I can feel my certified habit coach part giving me a shoulder pat as I type these words, btw. )</p><p>I clicked Ctrl+N, abandoned the poem for a while (we‚Äôll come back to it later), and begun writing a new note with a raw title How I Use My Personal Website.</p><p>I furiously typed the next 598 words. Breath. 600.</p><p>Then took this screenshot:</p><p><img src=\"/assets/600.jpg\" alt=\"600 words typed\" /></p><p>(There will be a few more in this article - I‚Äôve been taking them occasionally since I want to show how I do it, instead of just telling the story.)</p><p>If I‚Äôd like to publish it right now, I‚Äôd rename the name of the note by clicking on it - so it can be formatted for publishing. I‚Äôd call it:</p><pre><code>2022-04-18-personal-website-flow</code></pre><p>Which would make me consider the title of this article. In the past I‚Äôd obsess about finding a perfect title, but now I‚Äôd just leave it as it is, noticing my recovering perfectionist part closing its eyes with horror!</p><p>üôà</p><p>The part would get absolutely terrified, as it would begin following the note with this article being moved into the folder containing my published website.</p><pre><code>/web/heymichal.github.io/_posts</code></pre><p>At this point I actually went through the steps I just outlined, which brought the third look at the title of this article, which resulted in a decision to call it:</p><pre><code>Personal Website Flow - How I Use This Website</code></pre><p>Not perfect, but good enough for now and safe enough to try.</p><p>I‚Äôve copy-pasted the front matter from another post (I could have inserted it from template to make it faster), which forced me to add a description and relevant tags.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/front-matter.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of front matter\" /></p><p>And just like that this note is ready to publish.</p><p>2</p><p>1</p><p>üöÄ</p><p>It‚Äôs live.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/article-published.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of article showing on my website\" /></p><p>Please note that it‚Äôs imperfect as fuck.</p><p>I mean there is a paragraph typed below that I wrote before and decided not to include, but felt bad to delete it because it feels like a good paragraph to come back to at some point. Moreover, there are no screenshots included, and the links are all missing.</p><p>Definitely suboptimal.</p><p>But here‚Äôs the most important thing:</p><p>I just published a 911 words article in 20 minutes or so. That‚Äôs a second thing I published today.</p><p>Hey, I might tweet it, just for the laughs. I feel like it‚Äôs something that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ungatedcreative\" target=\"_blank\">Rob</a> would appreciate.</p><p>As I get ready to copy the link so I can place it into the tweet, I start reading the published article. Perfect - I‚Äôll catch some basic spelling mistakes and small shit like that. I won‚Äôt bother with deep proof reading, images or links.</p><p>‚è≥</p><p>Proofreading is now complete, which means I can cmd+Tab to GitHub Desktop and commit.</p><p>That is all, folks.</p><p>Funny enough, I decide not to take this final step right now, because I notice that lonely paragraph again, and on an impulse decide to make it an integral part of this article, rather than leaving a few random lines at the end of the article completely out of context. I guess that‚Äôs fair to you..</p><p>To give context, we need to return to the poem.</p><p>I was editing it so I can get it ready for a spoken word collaboration with <a href=\"https://instil.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jo√£o Moreira</a> - one of the two Portuguese men whom I connected with deeply many years back in Albania, and on my return to Edinburgh which was my home at the time, I immediately booked my tickets to Portugal to fly there 2 months later. It turned out that I‚Äôd find a Person I would spend 8 years together with, and eventually move to Portugal, where I‚Äôm living now (although it‚Äôs not the continental part of Portugal).</p><p>Okay, tangent finished. It‚Äôs still random. Forgive me.</p><p>In any case, the poem is still awaiting editing, which is actually perfect, because I feel like my work here is done for now.</p><p>I just need two clicks to republish this article, send the link to Rob, and then come back to what I was doing, before a sudden breeze of air would bring me here together with you.</p><pre><code>BIRDS SURFING OCEAN WIND VIDEO</code></pre><p>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1511800475422711811?s=20&amp;t=6XU3FUkpNfkxCtINWEKRIg\" target=\"_blank\">video in tweet</a>)</p><p>I used to be a turtle.</p><p>Now I am a bird.</p><p>üê¶</p><p>ps.

I also created a full version here.üê¶My personal website is pretty much targeted for me - so I can publish as much as possible.The fact that it‚Äôs live online, adds some pressure on the quality of what I publish, but more importantly helps me overcome my perfectionistic tendencies. For context, it took me 3 months to write [this article]. It was worth it, but I could have done it in 2 weeks. I just kept getting stuck in perfecting, even if deep down I knew that it will never be perfect anyway, and that‚Äôs totally fine, too. In the end, the 2.5 months of extra time increased it‚Äôs final quality by 1%.SAD TROMBONE PLAYSWell‚Ä¶ Mistakes were made, and it seems that I learned something from them:WEBSITE ENTERSHere‚Äôs how it works:I publish unfinished stuff, but I publish it consistently. And since [everything is written and managed directly inside my Obsidian vault], which is the central point of my digital [focus], I can update anything I publish effortlessly, at any time, on my laptop or phone. I press Alt+Tab, write a letter ‚Äúg‚Äù (for GitHub Desktop to appear as the first result) and press enter. Then click ‚Äúcommit to main‚Äù and finalise the process by clicking ‚Äúpush origin‚Äù. Robots do their work, and the website is updated.It takes me approximately 2 seconds.I keep seeing all my files on the left. Folder structure includes (among other things) three web projects (my personal website, [journalsmarter] and [microsolidarity in pico]), each with /assets folder containing images. I can manipulate all files, restructure websites, move files from one project to another, link in between etc, and then in 2 seconds all changes are published.This is the first part of my strategy, which is complimented by the fact that not many people read my personal website (or at least I assume so, and I have no data to check, because the site has no tracking of any sort, which is a deliberate decision because I find tracking on the internet quite creepy. But I digress). Not many readers = not much pressure, in fact it‚Äôs probably just me and you right now who have ever visited this page.No resistance to publish + no pressure to publish is a combo that really does it for me.Here‚Äôs my current example:I was editing a [poem] which I wrote during a sailing trip which begun the transition into the chapter of my life that has just concluded as I write these words right now (okay, not exactly, but the actual day of the new beginning is only a couple of days off, which makes me smile feeling into the magical world of synchronicities).As I was editing the poem, an idea bounced into my mind: to start writing a meta article about my writing workflow, because it feels like a useful gift I could offer to someone who‚Äôd like to make writing a self-inflicted addiction.That‚Äôs kinda what happened to me.I struggled to build a digital publishing habit, so I turned it into addiction.( I can feel my [certified habit coach part] giving me a shoulder pat as I type these words, btw. )I clicked Ctrl+N, abandoned the poem for a while (we‚Äôll come back to it later), and begun writing a new note with a raw title How I Use My Personal Website.I furiously typed the next 598 words. Breath. 600.Then took this screenshot:IMG(There will be a few more in this article - I‚Äôve been taking them occasionally since I want to show how I do it, instead of just telling the story.)If I‚Äôd like to publish it right now, I‚Äôd rename the name of the note by clicking on it - so it can be formatted for publishing. I‚Äôd call it:2022-04-18-personal-website-flowWhich would make me consider the title of this article. In the past I‚Äôd obsess about finding a perfect title, but now I‚Äôd just leave it as it is, noticing my recovering perfectionist part closing its eyes with horror!üôàThe part would get absolutely terrified, as it would begin following the note with this article being moved into the folder containing my published website./web/heymichal.github.io/_postsAt this point I actually went through the steps I just outlined, which brought the third look at the title of this article, which resulted in a decision to call it:Personal Website Flow - How I Use This WebsiteNot perfect, but good enough for now and safe enough to try.I‚Äôve copy-pasted the front matter from another post (I could have inserted it from template to make it faster), which forced me to add a description and relevant tags.IMGAnd just like that this note is ready to publish.21üöÄIt‚Äôs live.IMGPlease note that it‚Äôs imperfect as fuck.I mean there is a paragraph typed below that I wrote before and decided not to include, but felt bad to delete it because it feels like a good paragraph to come back to at some point. Moreover, there are no screenshots included, and the links are all missing.Definitely suboptimal.But here‚Äôs the most important thing:I just published a 911 words article in 20 minutes or so. That‚Äôs a second thing I published today.Hey, I might tweet it, just for the laughs. I feel like it‚Äôs something that [Rob] would appreciate.As I get ready to copy the link so I can place it into the tweet, I start reading the published article. Perfect - I‚Äôll catch some basic spelling mistakes and small shit like that. I won‚Äôt bother with deep proof reading, images or links.‚è≥Proofreading is now complete, which means I can cmd+Tab to GitHub Desktop and commit.That is all, folks.Funny enough, I decide not to take this final step right now, because I notice that lonely paragraph again, and on an impulse decide to make it an integral part of this article, rather than leaving a few random lines at the end of the article completely out of context. I guess that‚Äôs fair to you..To give context, we need to return to the poem.I was editing it so I can get it ready for a spoken word collaboration with [Jo√£o Moreira] - one of the two Portuguese men whom I connected with deeply many years back in Albania, and on my return to Edinburgh which was my home at the time, I immediately booked my tickets to Portugal to fly there 2 months later. It turned out that I‚Äôd find a Person I would spend 8 years together with, and eventually move to Portugal, where I‚Äôm living now (although it‚Äôs not the continental part of Portugal).Okay, tangent finished. It‚Äôs still random. Forgive me.In any case, the poem is still awaiting editing, which is actually perfect, because I feel like my work here is done for now.I just need two clicks to republish this article, send the link to Rob, and then come back to what I was doing, before a sudden breeze of air would bring me here together with you.BIRDS SURFING OCEAN WIND VIDEOI used to be a turtle.Now I am a bird.üê¶ps.

Do not HODL your tokens! Instead Give Whenever You Can ‚Äì GWYC (pronounce: QUICK)  If you realise that you are HODLing Gratitude Token(s), take a moment to be grateful for all the gifts in your life and give your token(s) away to someone that deserves it.  If you suspect someone is HODLing Gratitude Tokens, give them a Gratitude Token to model giving behaviour.  Whenever you run out of tokens, you can mint new Gratitude Tokens at any time at your local minting station. To mint, prepare a wooden piece, draw the Gratitude Token Symbol, and add a personal mark. Next, state your Proof of Work by completing an entry in the Gratitude Token Ledger by drawing your personal mark and answer in writing why are you minting this token.Ledger RecordsHere are the records from our Ledger at TDF.Introducing Gratitude TokensHere‚Äôs a suggested format. Tweak as necessary to fit your context.  Gratitude Modeling Check-in: Pass a Gratitude Token (eg. the first one you minted during the prep) as a talking stick. When it‚Äôs your turn to speak, share with the next person what are you grateful for to them. The aim of this round is to bring everyone to the gratitude vibration, as well as model using the token.  Gratitude Token Info: Share about the importance of gratitude and explain why you want to introduce this game in your community. If you have played this game before you can also share a personal story.  Tokenomics: Read out the tokenomics instructions and check for clarity. If you have a ‚ÄúHODL ‚â†¬†GWYC‚Äù sign, then show it while explaining rule 3 - it helps people get the joke.  Minting: Invite everyone to mint a token and record an entry into the ledger. Note that recording in the ledger might take a while.  Next Steps: Invite the group to pass the gratitude tokens. Share the collective challenge of the game: make every token pass through as many hands as possible.  Closing: Close the session with a check-out of your choice.Notes  Tokens don‚Äôt need to stay within a community. Make them travel ‚õµÔ∏èand remember to GWYC.

            "summary": "Facing the shadow as I approach another birthda",
            "content_text": "Out of curiosity I took a look at a numerological meaning behind the number thirty three, and it was certainly an encouraging moment, considering that I‚Äôm about to turn that age in a few days.  ‚ÄúThe 33 embodies both the intuitive, visionary qualities of the 11 and the 22‚Äôs ability to manifest these visions in the material world.‚ÄùKeep going‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúThis blend of a soft heart, inspiring outlook, and the ability to understand and communicate concepts of growth and healing are exactly what makes the number 33 the Master Teacher.‚ÄùNow, I don‚Äôt really care that much if this interpretation applies to my context or not, because I know that I can manifest any reality I choose. And the reality connected with the number thirty three seems definitely like something I‚Äôd like to aim to manifest in the coming years.A little confession:I‚Äôve been having a hard time recently.I guess it‚Äôs the proximity of another birthday that makes me consider existential questions such as what do I have to show for myself and what is my contribution to the world. It makes me think of the Funeral Exercise: what would be the speeches on your funeral like?.I guess there is an egoistic tendency here to ‚Äúbe special‚Äù, ‚Äúmake an impact‚Äù and simply ‚Äúmatter‚Äù, but I find that it‚Äôs also a useful lens to look at ones life, and brutally strip it off from all the mundane bullshit that doesn‚Äôt really matter.Anyway.Truth is, I‚Äôve had quite a difficult time while taking a long hard honest look at myself. I like to think of myself as a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù, whatever that means, and I do have a deep underlying sense that everything is unfolding perfectly, including this trying moment of meticulous self-assessment.In the same time I notice things that feel hard to admit.I feel angry.I feel impatient.I find it easy to start something, but hard to maintain it.I‚Äôm also noticing a big tension around the subject of money. Fuck, that‚Äôs actually a big one. Somehow, I find an expense of ‚Ç¨300 to visit my parents and sister after two and half years a significant hole in my personal budget and I need to carefully juggle my finances to make it happen. WTF.I live cheaply. I don‚Äôt need much. And yet, somehow I can‚Äôt seem to unlock access to the infinite financial abundance that the world has to offer, despite trying for years. It‚Äôs frustrating and it adds up to the feeling of anger. Perhaps the worst part is that I know that it‚Äôs all within myself and I can indeed shift it at any point. I just never managed to do it.Now, I‚Äôm not complaining by any means, and I do feel immensely grateful for what I have.In fact, I‚Äôve been gifted a beautiful lifestyle in an idyllic place, surrounded by people who I get to call my Island Family. That definitely counts for A LOT and it‚Äôs more than many people could ever wish for. It seems worth much more than a few zeros of net worth. And yet, a part of me can‚Äôt relax.So I lay down on the floor of my 3x3 wooden cabin in a beautiful forest with an ocean view, the most amazing house I‚Äôve ever lived in, and sink down into myself.Why am I feeling agitated?

            "content_html": "<p>Out of curiosity I took a look at a numerological meaning behind the number thirty three, and it was certainly an encouraging moment, considering that I‚Äôm about to turn that age in a few days.</p><blockquote>  <p>‚Äú<strong>The 33 embodies both the intuitive, visionary qualities of the 11 and the 22‚Äôs ability to manifest these visions in the material world.</strong>‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Keep going‚Ä¶</p><blockquote>  <p>‚ÄúThis blend of a soft heart, inspiring outlook, and the ability to understand and communicate concepts of growth and healing are exactly what makes the number 33 the Master Teacher.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Now, I don‚Äôt really care that much if this interpretation applies to my context or not, because I know that I can manifest any reality I choose. And the reality connected with the number thirty three seems definitely like something I‚Äôd like to aim to manifest in the coming years.</p><p>A little confession:</p><p>I‚Äôve been having a hard time recently.</p><p>I guess it‚Äôs the proximity of another birthday that makes me consider existential questions such as <em>what do I have to show for myself</em> and <em>what is my contribution to the world</em>. It makes me think of the Funeral Exercise: <em>what would be the speeches on your funeral like?</em>.</p><p>I guess there is an egoistic tendency here to ‚Äúbe special‚Äù, ‚Äúmake an impact‚Äù and simply ‚Äúmatter‚Äù, but I find that it‚Äôs also a useful lens to look at ones life, and brutally strip it off from all the mundane bullshit that doesn‚Äôt really matter.</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>Truth is, I‚Äôve had quite a difficult time while taking a long hard honest look at myself. I like to think of myself as a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù, whatever that means, and I do have a deep underlying sense that everything is unfolding perfectly, including this trying moment of meticulous self-assessment.</p><p>In the same time I notice things that feel hard to admit.</p><p>I feel angry.</p><p>I feel impatient.</p><p>I find it easy to start something, but hard to maintain it.</p><p>I‚Äôm also noticing a big tension around the subject of money. Fuck, that‚Äôs actually a big one. Somehow, I find an expense of ‚Ç¨300 to visit my parents and sister after two and half years a significant hole in my personal budget and I need to carefully juggle my finances to make it happen. WTF.</p><p>I live cheaply. I don‚Äôt need much. And yet, somehow I can‚Äôt seem to unlock access to the infinite financial abundance that the world has to offer, despite trying for years. It‚Äôs frustrating and it adds up to the feeling of anger. Perhaps the worst part is that I know that it‚Äôs all within myself and I can indeed shift it at any point. I just never managed to do it.</p><p>Now, I‚Äôm not complaining by any means, and I do feel immensely grateful for what I have.</p><p>In fact, I‚Äôve been gifted a beautiful lifestyle in an idyllic place, surrounded by people who I get to call my Island Family. That definitely counts for A LOT and it‚Äôs more than many people could ever wish for. It seems worth much more than a few zeros of net worth. And yet, a part of me can‚Äôt relax.</p><p>So I lay down on the floor of my 3x3 wooden cabin in a beautiful forest with an ocean view, the most amazing house I‚Äôve ever lived in, and sink down into myself.</p><p>Why am I feeling agitated?

            "content_text": "The first New Moon of 2022 is a perfect time to share with you my Yearly Review.It‚Äôs been a very special year in my life ‚Äì¬†it marked the beginning of a New Cycle, which I wish to be all about manifesting dreams. I feel like everything that happened this year was a long process of integrating everything that happened in my life so far, and preparing me for something new.Here‚Äôs the drawing of my year:I‚Äôll share with you a bit more about it, using a few scans from the pages of my 2021 journals, captured during my yearly review.Enjoy üíúYear of SquaresThe year begins with the Squares of course.You‚Äôll notice that they changed quite significantly through the year. This is the page that took me from 15 Nov 2020 to 12 Jan 2021.Squares were a major theme of the year. I finally figured out what they are really about, and what is the most effective and fun way for me to inspire others to play along. In September I finally transformed the unpronounceable Minimalist Journaling System into Infinity Squares, and launched a brand new email-based course.As you can see below, my squares evolved a lot. Here‚Äôs September 2021:And in case you‚Äôre wondering, I still haven‚Äôt skipped a single one in over 1400 days. It is the most fundamental self-alignment practice in my life.On the other hand, I also realised that I need to make space in my professional life. I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of confusion around JournalSmarter, which led to writing a letter to it (as in to the brand itself), where I tried to inquire what does JS want to become. After a long and painful process, I‚Äôve decided to radically simplify my entire approach and launched (today) a new website. JournalSmarter will no longer be my main professional focus, in order to make space for what I feel called to do (more on that later). I‚Äôll still keep the courses going and add a new journaling game / course whenever I feel like it. I also have a few pieces of the journaling puzzle that are ready to be published, so I‚Äôll make than happen in the next few days. And then it‚Äôs time to breathe.Paradoxically, by removing all the financial pressure from JournalSmarter, as well as radically simplifying how it works, I have a feeling that this project will be more successful than ever. And I admit that the moment of insight which lead me to describe journaling as an infinite game unlocked something that has been stuck for a long time.Welcome to JournalSmarter 3.0. I hope that it will bring you a lot of joy.üìñ‚ú®Year of PracticeIn December 2019 I had this crazy idea to offer a year-long cohort-based course, where I‚Äôll take 20 people on a journey of building 3 practices of their choice through the year.I‚Äôm still due to write an in-depth documentation article on that journey, so I won‚Äôt go into more details now, and instead I‚Äôll share about my own practices. Funny enough, they were completely different from what I expected them to be.BeingIn the summer I felt a call to ditch the comforts of a house and moved into a forest. It has been the most impactful summer of my life, along with 2013 (when I hitchhiked from Scotland to Greece) and 2017 (when I said goodbye to Edinburgh and began location independent life).Photo by Austƒója Liup≈°eviƒçi≈´tƒóBeing in the forest started a deep process of reconnection with myself, tuning into my intuition, which allowed me to rediscover what is important to me and how I want to manifest it. I am forever grateful to Jean-Daniel who allowed me to live on his land, as well as Austeja and Niko, who were my forest neighbours.My home in the Magical ForestI started to write poetry and letters again, I felt free like I haven‚Äôt in a couple of years, and I have learnt a few critical lessons, which I then integrated on a trip to the Mainland Portugal in September, which blew my mind beyond anything I knew before.WalkingThe seed of walking has been planted during my little camino in Faial island. I felt called to go there and connect with the island, and instead of cycling or driving I wanted to walk. So I walked for three days pretty much non-stop, covering the entire island, climbing up and down volcanoes, and sleeping in a hammock in the forest.In September, I spent three weeks walking in Lisbon and Porto, for most of my waking hours. Soon after walking up I‚Äôd leave the house and began walking, walking, walking only to come back late at night to sleep and then walk again the following day.I have never reached such a deep level of self-awareness until that trip. I‚Äôve experienced unprecedented abundance, flow of synchronicities, moments of beauty, unexpected beautiful connections with people and other beings, and powerful insights. It changed me.I don‚Äôt really have words to describe it just yet.I wrote ‚ÄúI want to‚Äù and then decided to strike it through, as ‚ÄúI am‚Äù walking and writing stories. It is happening already. And if you‚Äôre curious about what was the story written below, it is here and it was a moment of vulnerable and hilarious insight.In 2021, walking became my meditation. My way of Being. My lifestyle.It‚Äôs all I need in order to encounter and create Magic. And Magic is precisely what I‚Äôm after.Making SpaceCreating spaces for magic to emerge is something that I feel called for, and it‚Äôs also when I feel like fish in the sea.This year was special in that regard.I co-hosted the first community gathering in Pico, which was a game-changer for the community. Before the gathering I used to feel that I have friends in the island. After the gathering I had a family.I took this energy further with our second gathering, designed to 1) help each of us to understand what kind of community do we want to be a part of, and 2) find ways to support each other to make these visions come true in the context of our island. It was a very special moment for our community and for me, as a catalyst. Here‚Äôs a community catalysing game I prototyped during the gathering.I still remember the crazy brainstorming session when the game idea came to me:My wonderful island family gave life to the prototype and created a map full of exciting projects.I‚Äôve also created a performance with Austeja, which moved local people and kids in ways that we haven‚Äôt expected. We also co-created a more events in Pico, such as Slam Jam, Masking Around, and more. We also had our bi-weekly sharing circle and a drum crew. Loads and Loads of spaces and even more magical moments that emerged from there.I‚Äôve also had the honour to create a wedding ceremony for a dear friend and his lovely partner. I loved it and I‚Äôm game for creating more ceremonies. Call me üòâ.Apart from making spaces in real life, I‚Äôve also created some powerful digital experiences, such as Year of Practice (a year-long practice-building community), Habit Sprint (a three-month, focused version), Relational Weekly Review (a weekly co-journaling session boosted with relational growth), *Enspiral Europe Connection Weekend (an experiment in weaving social fabric in the European part of Enspiral network) and more.Intermission: Top Songs, Films, and Books of 2021.Three Songs That Moved MeAdult Jazz - Springfulbandcamp | spotifyAs I was about to depart for a trip that would turn out to be the most powerful journey in my life so far, I asked my best friend for a gift: a few songs to go along with me. Springful was the one that created a powerful emotional shift inside of me, and prompted me to dance, dance, dance and then dance some more, as I was deepening my self-awareness reaching unprecedented levels, while walking for hours in the streets of Lisbon and Porto.It is one of these few songs that will always stay with me, reminding me of this very special moment in my personal history whenever I get to listen to it.Milo - Folk Metaphysics soundcloud | spotify lyricsI remember the moment when this song came into my headphones for the first time. I paused. I listen to it, and then listened to it on repeat a few times to really understand the lyrics. There‚Äôs something about this song that puts me in a very special state of Being  ‚Äì¬†humble, honest, creative, melancholic, connected.Milo is one of the most important poets I discovered this year, and I highly recommend his work.Climbing Poetree - Awakeningbancamp| spotify lyricsSpeaking of poets, here‚Äôs two of them, united in a raw and powerful force of nature poetry. Listening to this song (and a few other ones) make me shiver, and there are not many songs that can do that.Note:I deliberately avoided youtube links for the songs, as I‚Äôm on a quest to set myself free from google. It‚Äôs not an easy task and it requires practice.Three Films that I absolutely lovedThe Twentieth Century MubiIncredible example of neo-German-expressionism, depicting the story of a Canadian prime minister rising to power. The vibe is really quite something, and it‚Äôs good old-school set design, not computer generated stuff.The Brick WikipediaDear, oh dear, what a feast.The dialogue, the characters, the intrigue, the cinematography‚Ä¶ I loved all of it. And translating the tropes of noir into American high-school environment works exceptionally well. Make no mistake ‚Äì this is nothing like a typical American high-school comedy. Brick is a piece of art.One of my favourite moments is the conversation when the hero rejects help from la famme:  BRENDANLook, I can‚Äôt trust you. You ought to be smart enough to know that. I didn‚Äôt shake up the party to get your attention, and I‚Äôm not heeling you to hook you. Your connections could help me, but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me. Better off coming at it clean.  LAURAI wouldn‚Äôt have to lead you in by the‚Ä¶  BRENDANI can‚Äôt trust you. Brad was a sap, you weren‚Äôt. You‚Äôre with him, so you‚Äôre playing him. So you‚Äôre a player. With you behind me, I‚Äôd have to tie one eye up, watching both of your hands. I can‚Äôt spare it.You‚Äôre absolutely right, Brendan. She is a player indeed.Another Round MubiFour school teachers embark on an experiment to prove an obscure theory: maintain a constant level of alcohol to see if it will make them happy. The result is a wonderfully dark comedy from the magnificent Scandinavian school of film-making.Speaking of good films, I can‚Äôt recommend MUBI enough. The curation is amazing, and instead of force-feeding whatever into your throat like Netflix, Mubi actually helps you find cinematic gems. This link gets you (and me) a free month.Honorable mention: A Gathering of the TribeA powerful, 9 minute short, perfectly fitting for our current times. It really touched me.Youtube linkBook of the YearSacred Economics by Charles Eisenstein. No doubt here.In fact, I find Charles to be one of the most important writers of today‚Äôs world. I can‚Äôt recommend checking out his work on Substack. Here‚Äôs one of the recent essays that expressed very accurately a lot of my feelings regarding that virus: A Path Will Rise to Meet Us.The Alternative Culture is here. All we need to do is shine ‚ú®Most of all, the 2021 shown me that the (for a lack of better word) global capitalist culture is not only complete bullshit (this I knew for a long time), but the alternative is already here and so many people already made the shift. It‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs happening. No more excuses and keeping the hamster wheel going.It‚Äôs been such a privilege to learn from and with all the wonderful souls I‚Äôve met this year.

Some of the letters will be public, and I‚Äôll keep adding them here.For now, there‚Äôs only a letter to Kiki, the wonderful cat that lives with me, which is an absolutely amazing being, and I‚Äôve learn a lot from her.And hey, since you are here right now:THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF MY LIFE.üíú üíú üíúSetting a new course for 2022New Lunar Year is a good moment to adjust the course I‚Äôm taking in life.I still feel like doing a bit more internal soul-searching in that field, but the direction is clear.My #1 priority in 2022 is to create and document regenerative communities.It seems like it‚Äôs a perfect Ikigai ‚Äì a direction encompassing something the world needs, something I‚Äôm good at, something I love doing and something I can get paid for. I wrote a sweet article about Ikigai a long time ago, and I actually feel like revisiting the exercises I shared there.But for now, here‚Äôs a hypothesis:If I make more space for my community catalysing activities and keep documenting what I do and how I do it (whether in Pico, the Azores, Enspiral or in digital spaces) my work will create a serious ripple effect inspiring and encouraging people to create their own communities and regenerative projects. And part of that ripple effect will come back to me in the form of gratitude and financial support allowing me to do more meaningful work in that area.In other words, instead of pushing to sell products, I‚Äôd rather be supported by people who believe that what I do is important, and who want to help me make it happen. So, I‚Äôve set up a Patreon account and I‚Äôm curious to see if it‚Äôs a viable path for me right now. It‚Äôd mean the world to me if you would consider being a part of that journey.You can see what I‚Äôm focusing on here.I wish you Freedom, Joy and Fulfilment. Let‚Äôs co-create a beautiful world where all beings can thrive. It‚Äôs possible. All we need to do is shine ‚ú®.Thank you for Being,Micha≈Çps.

            "content_html": "<p>The first New Moon of 2022 is a perfect time to share with you my Yearly Review.</p><p>It‚Äôs been a very special year in my life ‚Äì¬†it marked the beginning of a New Cycle, which I wish to be all about <strong>manifesting dreams</strong>. I feel like everything that happened this year was a long process of integrating everything that happened in my life so far, and preparing me for something new.</p><p>Here‚Äôs the drawing of my year:</p><p><img src=\"/assets/year-2021.jpg\" alt=\"Poster with year 2021\" /></p><p>I‚Äôll share with you a bit more about it, using a few scans from the pages of my 2021 journals, captured during my yearly review.</p><p>Enjoy üíú</p><h2 id=\"year-of-squares\">Year of Squares</h2><p>The year begins with the Squares of course.</p><p>You‚Äôll notice that they changed quite significantly through the year. This is the page that took me from 15 Nov 2020 to 12 Jan 2021.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/squares-2020-2021.jpeg\" alt=\"page of Infinity Squares\" /></p><p>Squares were a major theme of the year. I finally figured out what they are really about, and what is the most effective and fun way for me to inspire others to play along. In September I finally transformed the unpronounceable <em>Minimalist Journaling System</em> into <em><a href=\"https://infinitysquares.xyz\" target=\"_blank\">Infinity Squares</a></em>, and launched a brand new email-based course.</p><p>As you can see below, my squares evolved a lot. Here‚Äôs September 2021:</p><p><img src=\"/assets/squares-of-abundance.jpeg\" alt=\"Moonly spread with squares\" /></p><p>And in case you‚Äôre wondering, I still haven‚Äôt skipped a single one in over 1400 days. <strong>It is the most fundamental self-alignment practice in my life.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, I also realised that I need to make space in my professional life. I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of confusion around JournalSmarter, which led to <a href=\"/unexpected-birthday-letter\" target=\"_blank\">writing a letter</a> to it (as in to the brand itself), where I tried to inquire what does JS want to become. After a long and painful process, <strong>I‚Äôve decided to radically simplify my entire approach and launched (today) a new website.</strong> JournalSmarter will no longer be my main professional focus, in order to make space for what I feel called to do (more on that later). I‚Äôll still keep the courses going and add a new journaling game / course whenever I feel like it. I also have a few pieces of the journaling puzzle that are ready to be published, so I‚Äôll make than happen in the next few days. And then it‚Äôs time to breathe.</p><p>Paradoxically, by removing all the financial pressure from JournalSmarter, as well as radically simplifying how it works, I have a feeling that this project will be more successful than ever. And I admit that the moment of insight which lead me to describe <strong>journaling as an infinite game</strong> unlocked something that has been stuck for a long time.</p><p>Welcome to <a href=\"https://journalsmarter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JournalSmarter</a> 3.0. I hope that it will bring you a lot of joy.</p><p>üìñ‚ú®</p><h2 id=\"year-of-practice\">Year of Practice</h2><p>In December 2019 I had this crazy idea to offer a year-long cohort-based course, where I‚Äôll take 20 people on a journey of building 3 practices of their choice through the year.</p><p>I‚Äôm still due to write an in-depth documentation article on that journey, so I won‚Äôt go into more details now, and instead I‚Äôll share about my own practices. Funny enough, they were completely different from what I expected them to be.</p><h3 id=\"being\">Being</h3><p><img src=\"/assets/being-doing-thinking.jpeg\" alt=\"Triangle with Being, Doing and Thinking in the corners\" /></p><p>In the summer I felt a call to ditch the comforts of a house and moved into a forest. <strong>It has been the most impactful summer of my life</strong>, along with 2013 (when I hitchhiked from Scotland to Greece) and 2017 (when I said goodbye to Edinburgh and began location independent life).</p><p><img src=\"/assets/forest-michal.jpeg\" alt=\"Happy Michal in the forest\" /></p><p><em>Photo by <a href=\"https://austejaliu.com\" target=\"_blank\">Austƒója Liup≈°eviƒçi≈´tƒó</a></em></p><p>Being in the forest started a deep process of reconnection with myself, tuning into my intuition, which allowed me to rediscover what is important to me and how I want to manifest it. I am forever grateful to Jean-Daniel who allowed me to live on his land, as well as Austeja and Niko, who were my forest neighbours.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/forest-camp.jpg\" alt=\"My forest house\" /></p><p><em>My home in the Magical Forest</em></p><p>I started to <a href=\"https://write.as/fromtheforest/\" target=\"_blank\">write poetry</a> and <a href=\"/letters\" target=\"_blank\">letters</a> again, I felt free like I haven‚Äôt in a couple of years, and I have learnt a few critical lessons, which I then integrated on a trip to the Mainland Portugal in September, which blew my mind beyond anything I knew before.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/present-being.jpeg\" alt=\"The more present I am, the more time I have. I am Being.\" /></p><h3 id=\"walking\">Walking</h3><p>The seed of walking has been planted during my little camino in Faial island. I felt called to go there and connect with the island, and instead of cycling or driving I wanted to walk. So I walked for three days pretty much non-stop, covering the entire island, climbing up and down volcanoes, and sleeping in a hammock in the forest.</p><p>In September, I spent three weeks walking in Lisbon and Porto, for most of my waking hours. Soon after walking up I‚Äôd leave the house and began walking, walking, walking only to come back late at night to sleep and then walk again the following day.</p><p><strong>I have never reached such a deep level of self-awareness until that trip. I‚Äôve experienced unprecedented abundance, flow of synchronicities, moments of beauty, unexpected beautiful connections with people and other beings, and powerful insights.</strong> It changed me.</p><p>I don‚Äôt really have words to describe it just yet.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/walking-stories.jpeg\" alt=\"I walk and write stories\" /></p><p><em>I wrote ‚ÄúI want to‚Äù and then decided to strike it through, as ‚ÄúI am‚Äù walking and writing stories. It is happening already. And if you‚Äôre curious about what was the story written below, it is <a href=\"/vaclav-havel-and-conflicting-advice\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and it was a moment of vulnerable and hilarious insight.</em></p><p>In 2021, walking became my meditation. My way of Being. My lifestyle.</p><p>It‚Äôs all I need in order to encounter and create Magic. And Magic is precisely what I‚Äôm after.</p><h3 id=\"making-space\">Making Space</h3><p><strong>Creating spaces for magic to emerge is something that I feel called for, and it‚Äôs also when I feel like fish in the sea.</strong></p><p>This year was special in that regard.</p><p><strong>I co-hosted the <a href=\"https://pico.microsolidarity.cc/projects/summer-gathering-2021\" target=\"_blank\">first community gathering in Pico</a></strong>, which was a game-changer for the community. Before the gathering I used to feel that I have <em>friends</em> in the island. After the gathering I had a <em>family</em>.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/pico-summer-fire.jpeg\" alt=\"Summer Gathering Fire\" /></p><p><strong>I took this energy further with our <a href=\"https://pico.microsolidarity.cc/projects/autumn-gathering-2021\" target=\"_blank\">second gathering</a></strong>, designed to 1) help each of us to understand what kind of community do we want to be a part of, and 2) find ways to support each other to make these visions come true in the context of our island. It was a very special moment for our community and for me, as a catalyst. Here‚Äôs a <a href=\"/community-council\" target=\"_blank\">community catalysing game</a> I prototyped during the gathering.</p><p>I still remember the crazy brainstorming session when the game idea came to me:</p><p><img src=\"/assets/community-council-early-prototype.jpeg\" alt=\"Early prototype of the game\" /></p><p>My wonderful island family gave life to the prototype and created a map full of exciting projects.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/pico-projects-map.jpg\" alt=\"Pico Projects Map\" /></p><p><strong>I‚Äôve also created a <a href=\"/ouroboros\" target=\"_blank\">performance</a> with Austeja</strong>, which moved local people and kids in ways that we haven‚Äôt expected. We also co-created a more events in Pico, such as <em><a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/S8q92EhUcHMkTx3IASAbzDYd6w2GDEU+mOJuKsXsxrg/\" target=\"_blank\">Slam Jam</a></em>, <em>Masking Around</em>, and more. We also had our bi-weekly <a href=\"https://pico.microsolidarity.cc/projects/sharing-circle\" target=\"_blank\">sharing circle</a> and a <a href=\"https://pico.microsolidarity.cc/projects/drum-crew\" target=\"_blank\">drum crew</a>. Loads and Loads of spaces and even more magical moments that emerged from there.</p><p>I‚Äôve also had the honour to <strong>create a wedding ceremony</strong> for a dear friend and his lovely partner. I loved it and I‚Äôm game for creating more ceremonies. Call me üòâ.</p><p><img src=\"/assets/bruno-vera-wedding.jpeg\" alt=\"Bruno and Vera Wedding\" /></p><p>Apart from making spaces in real life, <strong>I‚Äôve also created some powerful digital experiences</strong>, such as <em>Year of Practice</em> (a year-long practice-building community), <em>Habit Sprint</em> (a three-month, focused version), <em>Relational Weekly Review</em> (a weekly co-journaling session boosted with relational growth), *Enspiral Europe Connection Weekend (an experiment in weaving social fabric in the European part of Enspiral network) and more.</p><hr /><h2 id=\"intermission-top-songs-films-and-books-of-2021\">Intermission: Top Songs, Films, and Books of 2021.</h2><h3 id=\"three-songs-that-moved-me\">Three Songs That Moved Me</h3><p><strong>Adult Jazz - <em>Springful</em></strong><br /><a href=\"https://adultjazz.bandcamp.com/album/am-gone-springful\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a> | <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/45opxzY71t0ZkTpZHUWNTX?si=6cedaee529f644a8\" target=\"_blank\">spotify</a></p><p>As I was about to depart for a trip that would turn out to be the most powerful journey in my life so far, I asked my best friend for a gift: a few songs to go along with me. <em>Springful</em> was the one that created a powerful emotional shift inside of me, and prompted me to dance, dance, dance and then dance some more, as I was deepening my self-awareness reaching unprecedented levels, while walking for hours in the streets of Lisbon and Porto.</p><p>It is one of these few songs that will always stay with me, reminding me of this very special moment in my personal history whenever I get to listen to it.</p><p><strong>Milo - <em>Folk Metaphysics</em></strong> <br /><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/mariellsoko/milo-metaphysics\" target=\"_blank\">soundcloud</a> | <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/7kj65lgrESm8DDmuRRII1V?si=2ce504ec551245b5\" target=\"_blank\">spotify</a> <br /><a href=\"https://genius.com/Milo-folk-metaphysics-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">lyrics</a></p><p>I remember the moment when this song came into my headphones for the first time.

You ought to be smart enough to know that. I didn‚Äôt shake up the party to get your attention, and I‚Äôm not heeling you to hook you.

Tweet me.Using Google is a habitAs I embarked on this journey, I noticed that quitting google is very similar to quitting a bad habit. Over numerous year of interacting with the internet, I have conditioned myself to default to google, and it‚Äôs not easy at all to give it up.This is a powerful realisation, because I am a certified habit building coach, and I have worked with clients (and myself) in the area of habit building for quite some time. This means I know exactly how to approach this situation effectively, or at least give it my best shot.The critical idea in habit-building is to steadily keep moving forward with a tiny habit, rather than overcommitting. This is why I don‚Äôt intend to migrate away from google in a week or so, but rather see it as an ongoing process, which I‚Äôm going to document here.Here‚Äôs my (ongoing) process:‚úÖGoogle ChromeI always preferred Firefox. Brave is cool too (I use it on mobile). Easy peasy.Google SearchMojeek + DuckDuckGoI swapped to DuckDuckGo years ago and it used to be my default search engine until I read this amazing article exploring private search engines. Turns out DDG stores some information, plus it is US-based, which doesn‚Äôt inspire my confidence at all.I‚Äôve decided to move to Mojeek as my primary search, and supplement it with DDG whenever necessary.Youtube for musicSpotifyI‚Äôve quit youtube for music when I joined Spotify. I have a family premium account. Other alternatives I like are Soundcloud and Bandcamp . The latter is a great way of supporting artists I love financially and downloading music for offline use, which will come in handy when I move to a sailboat ‚õµÔ∏è.‚è≥Google DriveCryptdriveI love cryptdrive and it was a no-brainer to switch. I‚Äôm using it for all new files, but I still need to migrate documents from Google Drive.Unfortunately, this is one of these things that have a tendency of sending me down a rabbit hole of over organising folders etc. I admit my drive is a combination of well organised PARA system and a folder with all the mess that I made over the years, which I never got to really clean up.It‚Äôs worth noting here that I‚Äôm redesigning my computer experience for offline-first and obsidian-centered.GmailProtonmailAfter going on a rabbit hole of research triggered by this article  about secure emails, I reached a conclusion that there is no fully private option on the market. Even Protonmail and Tutanota have serious issues.After considering different pros and cons, I made my decision to go with protonmail. It‚Äôs not perfect, but definitely better than gmail.Unfortunately, this is where the migration becomes tricky.1) All my digital world relies on multiple @gmail addresses and the process of moving to Proton is essentially an opportunity to practice one of the virtues I‚Äôm not so good at ‚Äì patience.2) My recovering-perfectionist mind wants me to create a perfect combination of email addresses, for personal, work and secret purposes.The habit-building work begins here. I created my free protonmail account and started using it for creating new accounts, subscriptions etc. I‚Äôll eventually move to a paid plan, as I ditch my business google accounts.Google CalendarProton CalendarThere are three problems with Proton Calendar:  the design on mobile is quite poor for my use case, and since I have to use the dedicated app I can‚Äôt fix it with a third-party app  development cycles in Proton are ridiculously long.  can it work with calendly or other scheduling tool?For now I started migrating some of my events there, and I‚Äôll continue the process over time.Youtube‚ö†Ô∏è research phase: D.tube and OdyseeI just caught myself automatically going to youtube to look for something (LYT obsidian videos), which yet again brings me back to the idea that quitting Google is like quitting a bad habit.I noticed though, so I went on to try alternatives. Dtube gave me nothing, but Odysee shown more promising results.I‚Äôm still not convinced to go with it and migrate all my youtube content there, but I am considering it.Google PhotosPiwigo?Google TranslateGoogle AnalyticsResources  Restore Privacy - an in-depth resource exploring digital privacy issues.

It‚Äôs noticeably colder today and I‚Äôm grateful that you are so committed to being as close as possible to me, whenever I‚Äôm sitting or lying down, like I am right now.I‚Äôm doing this thing of writing letters to people that I feel very grateful for in 2021, and as I‚Äôve been reflecting on that list, I‚Äôve noticed that you are missing. You are not a person, but it‚Äôs obvious to me that I should rename my list to ‚ÄúBeings I‚Äôm grateful for‚Äù. And you are certainly one of them.I absolutely love our co-living arrangement. It‚Äôs wonderful to feel your presence and play around with you. You brought me so much laughter when you were climbing the ladder, chilling with your body rolled into a pretzel, or simply being. You are activating a part of me that I love seeing more and more - playful, present, connected with myself and agile. I feel like you have a lot to teach me, and I‚Äôm grateful that you choose to live with me. Ultimately you are free, and that makes me happy. I guess this is obvious to you, but in the human world we‚Äôre conditioned to say nonsense like ‚Äúmy cat‚Äù. For some reason we claim ownership on another being, which I find, frankly speaking, ridiculous.You are your own being, and you are free to be here with me, or, if you choose, go somewhere else. I‚Äôd of course miss your presence, but I‚Äôd be okay. In the meantime, I‚Äôm happy to provide shelter, company, and food, and all the space you need to explore and live. I admit that I‚Äôd love to experience a day as your shadow once, to see what you are doing when you‚Äôre in the forest. Who knows, maybe one day I‚Äôll have a chance. In fact, it seems like a perfect adventure to embark on: to be a cat‚Äôs shadow. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd learn a lot.For now though, I‚Äôd just like to tell you one more time that I‚Äôm super grateful to have met you and watch your growth from a little cub who came on my lap immediately, to this wonderful healthy young adult that you now are.I wish you all that is most beautiful for you in the coming year, although I have limited understanding of what it might be.Thank you for Being,Micha≈Çps.

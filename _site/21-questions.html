That was in November, around the Full Moon time. I‚Äôm now back to Pico Island, living in a tiny cabin made of wood, surrounded by trees, with a view to the ocean. It‚Äôs a very inspiring place to be.</p><p><strong>I feel that a big part of the new cycle is about manifesting dreams.</strong> I‚Äôve been focused on the practical, productivity side of things for a while, but somehow I got disconnected a bit with my Big Dreams. They were always there, deep inside my heart, but I guess I didn‚Äôt feel that the time to make them happen is <em>now</em>. And now, I do feel that way. It‚Äôs very empowering.</p><p>I‚Äôve taken my microsolidarity game to the next level, begun the process of creating a cooperative in the island, and started moving the energy towards creating a Regenerative Network in the Azores. I‚Äôve coded my new website and set it up for effortless publishing right from Obsidian, which is a little thing, but it was something that has been on my mind for a long time. I‚Äôve been enjoying building with wood and prototyping the next iteration of the cabin where I live. I finally put some energy to kickstart the process of sailing to Brazil in November/December 2022. I‚Äôve started writing more letters again, and started reading them out in public for the first time, which felt special. I‚Äôve noticed two particular fears surfacing in my life and faced them head on. Things are definitely moving!</p><p>And there‚Äôs soooo much more to share. Looking forward to hugging you soon and going deeper, and also learning about your life!</p><h2 id="what-are-3-things-you-explore-daily-to-changebetter-your-life">What are 3 things you explore daily to Change/better your life?</h2><p>‚Äì Niko</p><ol><li>I explore myself and the world I interact with through journaling. It‚Äôs possibly the most powerful practice in my life. It helps me to continuously realign with myself.</li><li>Walking. Walking. Walking. To be honest, there are days when I don‚Äôt walk, but I always miss it a lot if I skip a day and I come back to it. It‚Äôs one of the most effective forms of my meditation.</li><li>Deliberately engaging in the action of <em>Being</em>.</li></ol><h2 id="what-are-some-things-you-can-talk-for-hours-about">What are some things you can talk for hours about?</h2><p>‚Äì Chris</p><p>Sailing, travel stories, journaling, optimizing inventory for having less items, designing experiences, relationships, islands, maps, seeking wisdom, becoming an elder‚Ä¶</p><p>But, perhaps more importantly, sharing from the heart.</p><h2 id="what-keeps-you-going">What keeps you going?</h2><p>‚Äì Bruno</p><p>I had to think for a while about that one.</p><p>In a nutshell, I have some kind of underlying sense of faith that life is unfolding itself perfectly, and I have real choice and influence over quite a lot of things (although not everything).</p><p>WIth that in mind, I feel that no matter what happens to me, I have a choice to make. That‚Äôs very empowering, because it makes me feel like I‚Äôm in a driver‚Äôs seat of my life. I do experience darker days, of course, but ultimately, I see them as inevitable challenges, and my overall experience of life so far led me to believe that, no matter the struggle, I can manifest any reality I want, which motivates me to actually make it happen on daily basis.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-decompressrecharge">How do you decompress/recharge?</h2><p>‚Äì Irem</p><p>Forest bathing, dancing, hugging, contact improvisation, (very long) walks, being held by people who make me feel loved.</p><h2 id="if-you-were-a-dog-what-would-be-your-fetch-ball">If you were a dog, what would be your fetch ball?</h2><p>‚Äì Irem</p><p>Dreams.

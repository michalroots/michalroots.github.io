   <title>My Microsolidarity Journey</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs begin with a bit of context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been location independent from 2017 and I absolutely love the freedom of being able to move whenever I feel it‚Äôs the right time to do it. There is however a price to pay for that freedom: &lt;strong&gt;the pain of saying goodbye to people dear to your heart, knowing that you might never see them again, because life is unpredictable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit, that there were times during my travels when I felt quite lonely. I did encounter many wonderful Souls, and the connections were intense but also short. I lacked continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day &lt;strong&gt;I decided to make a list of people I intuitively felt like reaching out to&lt;/strong&gt;. Some were close friends, and others were people I shared a single powerful moment sometime, somewhere. The following day I sent them all a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people replied and we had a call, others replied and that was it. Some never replied at all. I considered it a ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù. &lt;strong&gt;There‚Äôs time and space for each connection&lt;/strong&gt;. No hard feelings. With some people however I felt a clear ‚Äúconnection match‚Äù and some developed into beautiful friendships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to &lt;strong&gt;experiment with different frequencies for calls&lt;/strong&gt;. I found that different intervals work better for each relationship ‚Äì the rarer the call, the more ‚Äúmacro‚Äù the perspective. With some people it feels more natural to stay close to each other and reflect together on things that are alive right now, and with others it feels wonderful to look together at an entire year of our lives and share whatever comes up to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process, I also discovered that &lt;strong&gt;I generally prefer audio-only calls&lt;/strong&gt;. Video is nice, but I‚Äôd rather go for a walk rather than stare at a computer screen. With time, I gravitated towards async connections, such as long voice-notes, emails and letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few months, I eradicated the feeling of loneliness, and nurtured myself with recurring 1:1 conversations with people I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microsolidarity-experiments&quot;&gt;Microsolidarity Experiments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discovering &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsolidarity.cc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;microsolidarity&lt;/a&gt; in the beginning of 2020 was a huge milestone for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsolidarity gave me vocabulary to operate with and served as a practical guide to weaving wonderful social interactions at a bigger scale, with a possibility of changing the world together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three ideas really struck a deeper chord:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;People before projects&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì&amp;gt; start with finding the people that you can co-create magic with&lt;br /&gt;
2) &lt;strong&gt;Different group sizes serve different purposes&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì&amp;gt; large groups serve as a ‚Äúdating pool‚Äù to find your small groups where the magic happens&lt;br /&gt;
3) &lt;strong&gt;Verbs &amp;gt; Nouns&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì&amp;gt; theory is useful, but focus on the practice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat down and made another list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/who-are-the-people.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Who Are The People?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I let the names sink in for some time, feeling into small groups that would make sense to call into existence. When it felt right, I reached out to some people with an idea of launching ‚Äúmastermind groups‚Äù (which was the vocabulary more familiar to the people I was reaching out to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a part of an email exchange with one of the people I reached out to, introducing the idea of co-creating a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/crew-invitation-email.png&quot; alt=&quot;Crew Invitation Email Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months I launched a few crews:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Unicorns&lt;/strong&gt; ü¶Ñ - digital, 4 people (2 couples), mutual support, March 2020 - January 2021&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Angie&lt;/strong&gt; ‚ö°Ô∏è - digital, 4 people, exploring different topics, emotional development, May 2020 - May 2021&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loverz Powerz&lt;/strong&gt; üíú - digital, 4 people (2 couples), relationship-focused, May 2020 - May 2021&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routine Bootcamp&lt;/strong&gt; üöÄ - digital, 3 people, building routines together based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDWuHsyznf4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Metagame Mastermind Format (youtube video)&lt;/a&gt;, June - November 2020&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Circle&lt;/strong&gt; ‚ö™Ô∏è - presential, 4 housemates, weekly sharing circle followed by a co-living talk, February - June 2020&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pico Sharing Circle&lt;/strong&gt; üåÄ - presential, ~10 people, bi-weekly sharing circle, which eventually grew into an entire congregation. Here‚Äôs the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pico.microsolidarity.cc/projects/sharing-circle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation of the circle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-few-reflections&quot;&gt;A few reflections:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While I took the responsibility of being &lt;em&gt;the caller&lt;/em&gt; (the person who calls the pod to existence),** I deliberately let go of my default facilitating posture and practiced co-creating together.** The crews usually started with one or two ‚Äúmeta calls‚Äù diving into our intentions and deciding how do we want to be together, including technicalities such as rhythm, format etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crews had a timeframe agreed in advance. Each cycle was closed with a retrospective&lt;/strong&gt; when we decided what‚Äôs the next step, for example closing the crew or beginning another cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even if we committed to the schedule set up in advance, there was always at least one call that we had to skip due to life being life (na-na-na-na-na). Pods tended to work better with meetings no further than one month apart.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keeping a recording was kinda useless, but we all enjoyed sharing our notes with each other&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I kept a log of each pod for learning purposes&lt;/strong&gt;. I‚Äôm very grateful that I did, because I‚Äôm looking at them as I write this article.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I loved the process of coming up with the crew name together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-key-insight&quot;&gt;üëÅ Key Insight:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start your microsolidarity journey by calling a crew (or a couple of them). Today is a perfect day to do it. You‚Äôll learn all the skills you need along the way, and who knows - your crew(s) might eventually grow into a congregation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the resources at the end of this article if you need some extra help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enspiral&quot;&gt;Enspiral&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2021 I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enspiral.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Enspiral&lt;/a&gt;, a network of people helping each other do more meaningful work. The network design includes &lt;em&gt;pods&lt;/em&gt; (equivalent to &lt;em&gt;crews *in microslidarity lingo) to support building relationships within the network. While I haven‚Äôt joined any pods, mostly due to all the other crews I had going on at the time, I got involved in *Enspiral Europe Connection Working Group&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äì a small group hosting bi-weekly Connection Calls for Enspiralites based in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Write documentation of the formats tried in EECC and publish in the Enspiral Handbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;growing-a-congregation-in-pico-island&quot;&gt;Growing a congregation in Pico Island&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened in Pico surpassed my wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bit over one year since our very first sharing circle, we hosted two community gatherings, launch numerous projects, and created a strong foundation for a thriving congregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most surprising part is that it was actually quite simple. &lt;strong&gt;I called a sharing circle, and as people started to spend time getting to know each other on a deeper level, magic started to happen.&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, as we‚Äôre maturing as a congregation we‚Äôll encounter challenges. That‚Äôs just a part of the process. With a strong foundation of relationships based on trust, care and support, we‚Äôre ready for our next iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll document the process thoroughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://pico.microsolidarity.cc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-key-insight-1&quot;&gt;üëÅ Key insight:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It seems that at this point I became a microsolidarity practitioner and a congregation catalyst. I attribute my progress to two core competencies developed over time:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;practicing crewing&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì&amp;gt; there‚Äôs no learning without practice, and no amount of theory will teach you how to be and co-create together with the real people around you.
2) &lt;strong&gt;documenting the process&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì&amp;gt; publishing my process as an open-source documentation allowed me to regularly reflect on my learning journey. It also created beautiful connections with people who reached out to me with appreciation, questions, feedback and co-creating possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there‚Äôs one advice I could give to a microsolidarity beginner, it‚Äôs to do these two things from the start. I‚Äôm available to help if you could benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-beyond-pico&quot;&gt;Looking Beyond Pico&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2021 I felt a call to connect with Faial, one of the neighbour islands. As I hiked through its forests and volcanoes, I realised that the most wonderful thing about Pico (for me) is that it is a part of an archipelago containing nine islands, each with its own unique energy and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason why I love islands, is that each of them feels like an entire world. While clearly limited by water and no matter how small, it also feels infinite. There‚Äôs just so much to explore. I guess you can tell where I‚Äôm going with this. The Azores is not just one world ‚Äì it‚Äôs a Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it comes without surprise that &lt;strong&gt;my next step is to catalyse Azores Regenerative Network, and plant microsolidarity seeds in all islands, while integrating it with my life-long dream of sailing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soil is fertile and the people are already doing the Work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs going to sprout from the seeds that we are planting together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üå±&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gratitude&quot;&gt;Gratitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post wouldn‚Äôt be complete without expressing my deepest gratitude to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RichDecibels&quot;&gt;Rich Bartlett (twitter link)&lt;/a&gt; for compiling Microsolidarity and supporting countless people and projects around the world to co-create a beautiful world where all Beings can thrive üíú.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a wholehearted hug goes to everyone with whom I got to practice microsolidarity together. Thank you for co-creating magic ‚ú®.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Publish from Obsidian to Github</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/obsidian-to-github"/>
   <updated>2021-11-27T00:00:00-01:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/obsidian-to-github</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create and edit a Jekyll website in Obsidian. Publish to Github without friction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt know how to code)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;installing-jekyll-on-macos-mojave&quot;&gt;Installing Jekyll on MacOS Mojave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pain in the ass, but it worked eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Basic knowledge of Mac Terminal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read through the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;installation guide from Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.awesomeinc.org/tutorials/jekyll-basics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;simpler guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, spent a long time troubleshooting errors I couldn‚Äôt understand. Here‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chadduffey.com/2021/03/Jekyll-Poop.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the most succint solution&lt;/a&gt; that worked for me. Note: I had to run &lt;code&gt;bundle update&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; other commands. No idea why, but it works now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-preview-the-website-locally&quot;&gt;To preview the website locally:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;launch terminal and navigate to the folder with the site using  &lt;code&gt;cd ~/PATHTOFOLDER&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;serve jekyll with &lt;code&gt;Bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4000&lt;/a&gt; in your browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;uploading-code-to-github&quot;&gt;Uploading Code to Github&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was easy, because I did this before, and Github has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;good manual on how to do it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I created a new repository called &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I cloned the empty repository from Github to my computer using &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Github Desktop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I copied the contents of the website I have been editing on my computer to the github folder and pushed changes to Github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is now live at heymichal.github.io, but there are still a few things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;editing-with-obsidian&quot;&gt;Editing with Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the local folder with my github page as a vault in obsidian. That was super easy. I‚Äôm now editing this post in Obsidian, then commit changes and merge via Github desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that it takes some time for the changes to appear on the live site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üí° I later moved the entire local folder with my site into a /web folder inside my main obsidian vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-netlify&quot;&gt;Setting up Netlify&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to fix tags not working at all on the site. I suppose it‚Äôs because of some incompatibility between the template I started with and Github pages. I know that the template was using &lt;a href=&quot;https://netlify.app&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; to deploy the site, so I guess I‚Äôll do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super easy and works like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I added a new site from git&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pointed to my repository with the site on git&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deployed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have a funky netlify url: &lt;code&gt;https://sleepy-mahavira-46dee4.netlify.app/&lt;/code&gt; which I can change into a custom domain with SSL, which is the obvious next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also tested the speed of publishing and it works instantly. I edit in Obsidian, push with Github Desktop and it‚Äôs live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only trouble is that images don‚Äôt seem to be showing at all in previews on social media (I‚Äôm using &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialsharepreview.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this tool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;twitter card validator&lt;/a&gt; to test). I checked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://milanaryal.com.np/integrating-social-meta-tags-into-jekyll/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YAML frontmatter&lt;/a&gt; and it all seems fine to my eye:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;layout: post &lt;br /&gt;
title: The Red Caped Girl &lt;br /&gt;
description: The magic happens when I tune into myself. &lt;br /&gt;
image: /assets/touch-of-universe.jpg &lt;br /&gt;
tags: [letters] &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and yet, I keep getting this error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;og:image can&apos;t be found at the defined URL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll troubleshoot it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-custom-domain&quot;&gt;Setting up custom domain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was quite straightforward, even if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; from Netlify was a bit overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up custom domain, when you get the new DNS configuration login to your domain registrar and setup the new DNS configuration, and then wait for some time for the website to show up at the new address. It took around 2 hours in my case, and the site is now operational!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üéâ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;troubleshooting-ssl-certificate&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting SSL Certificate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that while the site was live, something didn‚Äôt work with the automatic SSL encryption. I went to domain settings in Netlify, clicked on ‚Äúrenew certificate‚Äù and less than a minute later it was working properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optimising-obsidian--github-flow&quot;&gt;Optimising Obsidian &amp;lt;&amp;gt; Github Flow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I‚Äôve been using a separate obsidian vault for my website, but actually, why not keep it all together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve created a new folder &lt;code&gt;/web&lt;/code&gt; in my main obsidian vault and I moved the folder with website files &lt;code&gt;heymichal.github.io&lt;/code&gt; inside.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;27 November 2021 üåó&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dear-santa&quot;&gt;Dear Santa,&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in a privileged position of my basic monthly expenses being more or less covered by my online business, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn‚Äôt easy to get here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took four years of being constantly challenged by the entrepreneurial learning curve. One of the biggest difficulties revolves around money. In a nutshell: &lt;strong&gt;I feel very little alignment with the current capitalist system and I‚Äôd like to embody a different paradigm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that isn‚Äôt easy when I depend on my own business to bring income. On one hand I am fully committed to release products that genuinely enrich lives and contribute to co-creating a beautiful planet where all beings can thrive. On the other, I feel pressure to make enough to pay the basic expenses. With the entrepreneurial world saturated with content prioritizing making more money rather than &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how aligned&lt;/em&gt;, it‚Äôs been hard to stay grounded and maintain a relatively steady course aligned with what my heart believes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it‚Äôs been kinda working lately, and I feel that my work is tuning in more and more with my values, while bringing in enough financially to sustain my basic needs, and leaving more time and energy to &lt;em&gt;give freely&lt;/em&gt; to work that matters that I don‚Äôt want to charge for within the capitalist economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, I deeply believe that &lt;strong&gt;not everything should be monetized&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regenerating the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healing oneself and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing the Light to inspire and encourage more people to enter into the upwards spiral of the beautiful world that our hearts know is possible &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my priorities, and while I‚Äôm committed to this path anyway, I could certainly use your help. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this letter to ask you for a Gift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minimalist on a constant journey to have less items and more space, I learned that offering a gift is a beautiful but challenging art. For example, for a long time my family kept giving me stuff, which while being given from the heart and therefore appreciated, was, generally speaking, useless for me and only created unnecessary clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I learned through this process is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) experiences generally make much better gifts for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) it is my responsibility to communicate clearly which gifts are the most aligned with what my heart points me towards right now, instead of expecting another person to know that intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This letter is an externalisation of these two lessons in a form of a public wishlist, supported by a firm belief that there is plenty of abundance of different sorts all around, and that within the Gift Economy (which we are indeed all a part of) the gifts gravitate towards the place where they are needed most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not saying that the items on my list are &lt;em&gt;universally speaking&lt;/em&gt; the biggest voids in the universe waiting to be filled. &lt;strong&gt;I already have all that I need.&lt;/strong&gt; However, it is possible that you are in a position to fill these voids for me, and thus make a real positive impact in my life, and, through ripple effect, the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether that‚Äôs the case or not, I‚Äôm grateful for your presence, and I wish you wonderful Winter Holidays, whichever and whenever you choose to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Love and Gratitude,&lt;br /&gt;
Micha≈Ç.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ps. The List:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;education&quot;&gt;Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permaculture Design Course&lt;/strong&gt;, residential in Portugal (or even better, in Azores) or online, because I believe that permaculture is one of the most important fields to study right now, and I have pretty much zero experience with it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kernel.community/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Kernel Online Course&lt;/a&gt;, because web3 and blockchain opens amazing possibilities for regenerating the world at scale, and I‚Äôd love to start my journey in this area by building something beautiful with other amazing people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greaterthan.works/academy/thriving-networks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thriving Networks online course&lt;/a&gt;, because I‚Äôm building a &lt;a href=&quot;pico.microsolidarity.cc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Regenerative Network in the Azores&lt;/a&gt; and I could really use some extra support with the upcoming challenges. Knowing the humans behind this course, I feel that it‚Äôs precisely the right place for me to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-growth&quot;&gt;Personal Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contact Improvisation / Ecstatic Dance residential gathering/course in Portugal, because connecting with other humans through dance is one of the most effective ways of addressing one of the biggest fears I‚Äôm working though at the moment, and it‚Äôs part of the healing that is very important for me to experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sailing opportunities of any shapes and sizes, ideally to/from/within the Azores, because sailing is the core foundation of my soul and I want to bring this gift to the world by hosting regenerative retreats at sea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;items&quot;&gt;Items&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sailboat&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, it‚Äôs a bold ask, but you never know. A sailboat would allow me to ditch flying for good, and move between the islands in the Azores (and beyond) to catalyse the regenerative network, as well as host transformative experiences at sea. I‚Äôm also feeling called to Brazil (and I intend to answer that Call). I‚Äôm looking to sail there from Europe in Nov/Dec 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A functioning typewriter, to write &lt;a href=&quot;/letters&quot;&gt;letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A compact mechanical keyboard with Bluetooth, EN or PT layout, to write digital letters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A hardcover book about astrology in English with strong focus on charts and visuals. I want to study different types of maps and astrology is a map.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A hardcover edition of &lt;em&gt;Tao Te Ching&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solar panels to power my tiny cabin and the community space next to it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://berkey-waterfilters.fr/products/systeme-de-filtration-deau-travel-berkey-version-reduite-du-big-berkey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Travel Berkey Water Filter&lt;/a&gt;, because drinking highest quality water is essential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;‚Äî&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I borrow the term ‚Äúbeautiful world that our hearts know is possible‚Äù from the wonderful book by Charles Eisenstein &lt;a href=&quot;https://charleseisenstein.org/books/sacred-economics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sacred Economics: Money, Gift &amp;amp; Society in the Age of Transition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]¬†&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Waiting At Peter&apos;s</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/waiting-at-peters"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Peter‚Äôs Cafe, Port of Horta&lt;br /&gt;
22 November 2021&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sitting in the iconic sailing bar in the island of Faial before taking a ferry across to Pico. I filled my body with a way-too-sweet-but-still-delicious chocolate cake and begun writing this letter. It wasn‚Äôt clear to me to whom it is directed to, so let‚Äôs say that it is for you ‚Äì to receive in this very moment. Thank you for holding the space for me. I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just came back from the Mainland yesterday, but the backpack containing all my gear didn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs quite frustrating to be walking around in the rain with a plastic bag holding a few items I took with me on the plane: my journal and tablet, a deck of tarot cards, headphones, headtorch, a folder with some documents and empty sheets of A4 paper, a poncho made of Serra-de-Estrela wool, a water bottle, a thermal cup, two carabiners, plus the clothes that I‚Äôm wearing. It‚Äôs a combination of items that tells a lot about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôm waiting for the airline to call me to arrange the drop-off of my backpack which arrived to Faial just in time to get the 1415 ferry to Pico (which I‚Äôm writing down with the intention of manifesting it into reality), I get to practice letting go. Of course, my stuff doesn‚Äôt matter, but I do feel attached to the combination of items I have carefully assembled over the last few years of scaling down. It‚Äôd be a bitch to replace a few of them, and also, quite a lot of money ‚Äì¬†a resource that is quite scarce in my life. While certainly inconvenient, I do trust that my backpack is already on it‚Äôs way back to me, and even if it isn‚Äôt, I know that it‚Äôs just stuff ‚Äì¬†even if precious to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What matters is the experience of Being in the Mainland, and all the processes, internal and external, that happened during this journey, and, as well, the processes that are about to begin &lt;em&gt;because of&lt;/em&gt; this journey.&lt;/strong&gt; Because it does indeed feel like the beginning of another cycle. I can feel that something deep has shifted within me, something cracked and opened, some subconscious pattern (or patterns) were overwritten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the beginning though, I feel that it‚Äôs worth inquiring ‚Äúof what?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know that yet, but if I‚Äôd have to look for some words, I‚Äôd lean into letting go of fears holding me back, dreaming big, and manifesting these dreams into reality with an open heart shining with light. Yes, that feels good to write down and now say it out loud to you. &lt;strong&gt;No Fear. Dream Big. Manifest. Shine.&lt;/strong&gt; I left an empty page for setting the intentions during the Full Moon, because I wasn‚Äôt clear on them yet. I guess this is the time to write them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did, and as I was sensing into what to write next, I receive the phoneceall. My backpack is in Horta and it will be delivered to the ferry terminal on time to get the 1415 ferry to Pico. No Fear. Dream Big. Manifest. Shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is the reason why I felt like writing this letter. &lt;strong&gt;Six powerful words are now engraved into my mind to remind it, what my heart already knew. No Fear. Dream Big. Manifest. Shine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two hours until the ferry. It‚Äôs time to engage in a few errands and then come back to the island that is now my home and begin the new cycle of my life. I‚Äôm so excited for what‚Äôs to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Fear. Dream Big. Manifest. Shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Love and Light,&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Last Night In Lizbon</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/last-night-in-lisbon"/>
   <updated>2021-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/last-night-in-lisbon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;18/10/2021&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dear-lizbon&quot;&gt;Dear Lizbon,&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs our last night together and I‚Äôm sitting on a square writing a letter to you. You‚Äôre a Beautiful City, and I‚Äôm so grateful for everything you have allowed me to experience and discover. It‚Äôs an incredibly intense time, with unprecedented depth of self-awareness, allowing me to identify fears holding me back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that we‚Äôre all afraid, some more than others, but this primary emotion is something we all share. Fear of sickness and death. Fear of the Unknown. Fear of being left behind. Fear of being alone. Fear of missing out. Fear of rejection. Fear of being judged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many fears, it‚Äôs not surprising that each and every one of us is a mess, in their very unique and irrepeatable way. And yet, Fear can be overcomed, just like any pattern, no matter how deep, can be rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the process starts with noticing the Fear, creeping in the deep ocean of the subconscious mind, and bringing it up t the surface of awareness. And then ‚Äì embrace it. That‚Äôs the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oppressing, repressing, suppressing, pretending it‚Äôs not there, numbing, distracting, and other clever strategies can work in the short run, but ultimately Fear awaits to be acknowledged head on and embraced, like any other being on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once accepted, it looses it‚Äôs paralyzing power. allowing for a deep wholehearted hug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the heart truly open, no Fear can be.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Red Caped Girl</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/the-red-caped-girl"/>
   <updated>2021-10-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/the-red-caped-girl</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What just happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt intuitively, which comes easy to me recently, since I‚Äôve started spending most of my waking hours walking, that it is really important for me to go out of the house and have a dance. And then, maybe sit down by one of the three inviting tables on a public square in front of my flat, surrounded by a quiet residential island in the middle of Alfama, and process what is happening to me right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed my intuition down a curvy staircase, poured myself a cup of hot yogi tea, which fits quite well to my current circumstances since I seem to be a walking yogi these days, and started dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I was a bit shy, as the only other person on the square was clearly observing the feathers sticking out of my hair. He even stopped looking at his phone, focusing his gaze completely on me, which made me a bit uncomfortable, although not enough to stop me from dancing wholeheartedly as a song perfectly aligned with my current mood entered into my headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept dancing for a while, taking short breaks for a sip of tea, a stretch and an observing look at the trees growing out of the tiny cubical stones covering the square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy with the phone left eventually. I kept on dancing, and feeling tensions of the day disintegrate into the particles before leaving my body completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was setting myself free from tension, a girl in a red cape passed by on her scooter. A couple walked by. A lady parked her tiny car in the only remaining gap on the street. I kept dancing, until my body communicated that it‚Äôs time to sit down and process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote down a few key ideas worth remembering, did some rapid fire brainstorming and was about to decide what to do next, but‚Ä¶ the choice was made for me, as the girl in the red cape strolled into the square and sat by one of the three tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wrote her name and phone number in my journal, after a short but beautiful moment of connection as our energies magnetically attracted each other, so we gravitated, more or less subconsciously, to this very square, in the middle of a capital city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These synergies and inexplicable gravitational pulls keep amazing me with abundant regularity. How is it possible that I keep being in the exact right place in the exactly right time to experience a magical moment, which is increasingly hard to disregard as accidental or random?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it is or not, it doesn‚Äôt matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl in the red cape shared with me that by being in a certain way we attract other people vibrating in a similar frequency. I guess all beings do. Like it or not, we‚Äôre all made of empty space, and particles which vibrate in a symphony naturally gravitating towards harmonious co-existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In moments like these it seems insane not to redistribute the energy available to me in this very moment to vibrate in the highest frequency I can reach, attracting more magic into my life, so I can send ripples amplified by waves pouring out of open hearts of beings around me into all directions, inner, outer and beyond.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vaclav Havel and Conflicting Advice</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/vaclav-havel-and-conflicting-advice"/>
   <updated>2021-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/vaclav-havel-and-conflicting-advice</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sitting in a park by the table dedicated to Vaclav Havel, waiting for something to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, a very specific thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beautiful girl to appear out of thin air that would have a beautiful soul, and energy and space to co-create a magical moment including physical intimacy with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel fear as I disclose this information but these are the facts: I feel a deep need for my body to be loved and feel wanted. It‚Äôs been a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here it gets interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The life, a curious mistress, teaches me that I both can and can‚Äôt have what I want, which while being a profound guidance is also some fucking conflicting advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one moment I connect to the infinite cosmic reality, the ‚ÄúBig We‚Äù, as my friend calls it, and manifest any reality I choose, provided I‚Äôm specific enough to verbalize it and put it out there into the Universe, ideally out loud while facing one of the raw elements in the time when specific celestial bodies align. But to be fair, any space can become sacred if only treated with appropriate reverence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow is a blessed state to be in for sure, and yet, it tends to end abruptly without notice, leaving me confused, disconnected, and lonely. Still waiting for the magical girl to appear, caress my back without warning, look deeply at me, and deliberately kiss my neck slowly to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can feel the shivers. But, whether I like it or not, it is not the reality, at least not in this very moment. Feel free to prove me wrong though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sit with myself, unfolding knots tangled over the light shining from within, I feel, yet again, the conflicting advice of the Universe and it‚Äôs teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could remain still, witnessing my feelings arise and pass away in the infinite flow of impermanence, both blissful and difficult to accept, especially at times when the conscious choice of letting go is particularly hard. I know you‚Äôve been there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could also act upon this very moment, and instead of waiting for the magic to happen, create the magic myself, with a not-so-litte help of the Universe, provided it‚Äôs a day when Good Fortune smiles at my cute attempts of seducing a powerful woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs difficult, because as I sit still with this process happening inside of me, and become conscious of it as I write it down, and now, although it‚Äôs a very scary thought, sharing it out loud with you, I feel that I‚Äôm growing inside, slowly, awkwardly, and with a fair degree of metaphysical pain, but ultimately becoming a person that is more aware and therefore loving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process of growth feels important to go through, so that‚Äôs probably why I am still here, right in the middle of this mess of myself, dying along with my unfulfilled desires, and reviving along with another moment given to me to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a gift to be able to live this very conflict. To &lt;em&gt;Be&lt;/em&gt;, still and motionless, witnessing what is and &lt;em&gt;Being&lt;/em&gt; with it‚Ä¶ or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This power of deliberately changing my mindset gives me shivers, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm still here, making space for the magical girl to touch my soul and body and help me heal, but I‚Äôm not waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm actively &lt;em&gt;Being&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like that, as I let go of my expectations and fully accept this moment, the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girl doesn‚Äôt appear, but my soul is touched by something strong and I can feel the knots loosening allowing me to breathe deeper and smile wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a precious moment, and I‚Äôm grateful to Vaclav Havel for providing me with this table in a park so I could live through it and share the tale with you.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Empty</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/empty"/>
   <updated>2021-10-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/empty</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm in this beautiful house and my heart feels so happy it‚Äôs a bit overwhelming. Fortunately the familiar gong sounds ground me, as my thoughts sink into the mindset of deliberate being by walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I let go of thinking and sink into this moment, yet another container for magic. I feel so charged with something, something powerful. I can attribute some of that to cacao in my bloodstream, but I have this intuition that it‚Äôs much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something is happening right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I walked, I opened myself. To what - I don‚Äôt know, but it feels precisely like the right kind of opening necessary to allow myself to become aware of yet another layer of knots and patterns running in the back of my subconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose to set myself free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right in this moment, as I write these very words, right here in this place in which I feel so connected to something much bigger than myself and also this stardust, light and empty space that constitutes what I think of myself as me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose to set myself free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free from triggers, free from scripts, and most importantly, free from Fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom from fear is the hardest freedom to cultivate, yet, just like any kind of freedom, it‚Äôs just a mindset, and right here, right now, in this very moment, I am letting go of Fear and overwriting default behaviours with empty space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empty space is sacred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It allows for new seeds, planted with Love and intention, to sprout into reality I choose to experience in this very moment followed by many to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this very moment I am empty.
In this very moment I am free.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Mix dates well. Then add 1/4c of daty-water and blend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add coconut oil, peanut butter, cocoa, almonds, salt and cayenne pepper and blend well together. Food processor would be great, but you can do it with a blender and by hands.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake at 180¬∞C for 15m then cool for at least 20m before cutting.&lt;/li&gt;
